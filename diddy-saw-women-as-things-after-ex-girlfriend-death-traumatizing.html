Diddy's Miami and Los Angeles homes were raided in March 2024.</p><p>A new report came out, which doesn't paint Diddy in a good light, but attempts to offer some explanations into why his behavior became so erratic. According to new sources, it was the death of the love of his life, Kim Porter, that led to the rapper's questionable treatment of the people around him. Especially women.</p><h2 id=diddy-39-s-attitude-toward-women-reportedly-changed-when-his-ex-died>Diddy's Attitude Toward Women Reportedly Changed When His Ex Died</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/diddy-combs-imagn.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amid the scandal surrounding Diddy Combs, new reports have come up explaining the rapper's downfall. Apparently, it all started when his ex-girlfriend and mother of his children, Kim Porter, passed away. According to new reports, it changed his attitude toward women completely, and he lost respect for people as he saw that no one could compare to her.</p><p><strong>"When Kim died, it rocked Diddy's world," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an insider said to Us Weekly</a>. "It was a massive shock and a turning point. All the other women in his life were playthings. Kim was the real deal. It was all down from there."</strong></p><p>Of course, grief is no excuse to treat anyone like a "plaything", and far from helping Diddy's case, this admission really shocked people. It is true, however, that the rapper was in pieces when Kim Porter died, and it surely changed something in him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"For the last three days I’ve been trying to wake up out of this nightmare. But I haven’t," Diddy wrote shortly after she died. "I don’t know what I’m going to do without you, baby. I miss you so much. Today I’m going to pay tribute to you. I’m going to try and find the words to explain our unexplainable relationship. We were more than best friends, we were more than soulmates. WE WERE SOME OTHER S**T!! And I miss you so much. Super Black Love.</strong>"</p><h2 id=diddy-39-s-questionable-behavior-allegedly-started-long-before-kim-porter-39-s-death>Diddy's Questionable Behavior Allegedly Started Long Before Kim Porter's Death</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sean-diddy-combs-graham-norton-show.jpg><p>While Kim Porter's passing probably marked a turning point in Diddy's life, many celebrities have spoken about the rapper's questionable, and sometimes dangerous, behavior. And the stories they shared allegedly took place long before 2018, the year his ex died.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Former "Extra" host Tanika Ray, who was a backup dancer for the rapper in the 90s, said <a href=#>she had a "horrific" experience with him</a>, which she was too scared to even speak aloud.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/aubrey-o-day-diddy-combs.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Aubrey O'Day Says Former Boss Sean 'Diddy' Combs' Lawsuit Came 'Too Late'">Aubrey O'Day Says Former Boss Sean 'Diddy' Combs' Lawsuit Came 'Too Late'</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>While the news that Diddy Combs had his houses raided might have been a shock to a lot of people, it wasn't to Aubrey O'Day.</p><p><strong>"I just knew to avoid him at all costs," she said. "Yes, I danced for him and kept my space. I was on the Vote or die airplane and kept my space. I interviewed him for his projects and kept my space." <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She also added that people shouldn't be shocked by the recent allegations</a>. "Nothing that is happening is surprising," she stated. "Shame on all those men that let this continue."</strong></p><p>The lawsuits against him are still in process, and it's too early to tell what the consequences will be, but things aren't looking well for the rapper.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopyUrnq0rdZmrqillaN6or%2BMrZ%2BippeoeqKy056pZp2oYrSqvsufqaKdnpl6pbHArZ9mrKKWwq6t06KxoqaXZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-shady-side-of-drake.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Shady Side Of Drake">&larr;
