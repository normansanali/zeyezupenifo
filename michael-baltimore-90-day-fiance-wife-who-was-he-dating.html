Well, he’s now arrested for attempted homicide! Allegedly, the reality star shot his former employer Kendell Jerome Cook to death in May 2021.</span></p><p><span>So, what happened? Also, did he have a wife at the time? Or, was he dating someone? Find answers below.</span></p><h3><b>Michael Baltimore [90 Day Fiance] Arrested</b></h3><p><span>Michael Baltimore was arrested in Florida on January 13, 2023, six months after his name was added to the United States Marshal Service’s 15 Most Wanted list. Yes, the wanted list! Infact, there even was a $25,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives also offered a $10,000 reward, and Cumberland County Crime Stoppers offered an additional $2,000.</span></p><p><span>According to the arrest record, Michael was charged with a handful of crimes, including homicide, attempted homicide, possession of fentanyl, and possession of a weapon by a felon.</span></p><p><span>It seems back in May 2021, GQ Barbershop owner Kendell Jerome Cook was fatally shot while another man was injured at his shop in Carlisle, Penn. Allegedly, Michael was the one with the gun and he fired as a personal conflict escalated. Reports also stated that Michael had been threatening the owner for several months before the shooting.</span></p><p><span>Six months later, Michael was then first arrested for an entirely different matter, and when the officers scanned his fingerprints —&nbsp; he was on the “Most Wanted” list.</span></p><p><span>As per CNN, authorities said he attempted to give officers a fake name, and he was discovered with a loaded handgun, drugs, and three fake ID cards.</span></p><p><span>The last we checked, Michael was being detained in Florida, where he faced local charges.</span></p><p><span>For those who want to know about the victim, Kendell Jerome Cook was a Harrisburg, Pennsylvania native shot to death on May 22, 2021. He was 39 at the time and running his barbershop </span><i><span>GQ III </span></i><span>in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He is survived by his sons Darius Allen Hollman and Keyvon Louis Cook and daughter Kaymani Marie Cook.</span></p><h3><b>Michael Baltimore [90 Day Fiance] Wife</b></h3><p><span>Michael Baltimore didn’t seem to have a wife. This means he was still enjoying the dating game before his arrest.</span></p><p><span>Infact, he was with a woman when he was arrested on the morning of January 13, 2023.</span></p><p><span>Reports stated that the day before the DPD responded to the altercation after a “man with a knife threatened to retrieve a gun from his car and the suspect then fled in a car driven by a woman.” The police discovered the car the next morning, arrested Michael, and let the woman go.</span></p><h3><b>Michael Baltimore [90 Day Fiance] Who Was He Dating On The Show?</b></h3><p><span>Michael Baltimore wasn’t the main cast of </span><i><span>90 Day Fiance</span></i><span>. In other words, he didn’t date anyone on the show.</span></p><p><span>The only time he appeared on the show was in season 4 of </span><i><span>90 Day Fiance: Happily Ever After?</span></i><span> as a friend of the cast. Co-incidentally, both he and the victim in the homicide case, Kendell Cook, appeared in the season when they befriended Jay Smith after he moved to the U.S. to marry Ashley Martson. Later, they were also the ones who informed Ashley that her husband Jay, had an affair with a woman in the barbershop bathroom.</span></p><p><span>After hearing about the shooting, Ashley shared a related news article on her IG, captioned, “I’m truly saddened to see this. Praying hard for everyone involved. This is the barbershop who told me about Jay’s transgressions on 90 Day Fiance.”</span></p><p><span>Also, she followed it with another IG post, captioned, “ “RIP Kendall” along with a breaking heart animated gif.</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is 90 Day Fiance’s Michael Baltimore?</b></h3><p><span>Michael Baltimore was 44 years of age when he was arrested in Jan 2023.</span></p><p><span>He was 4 years older than the victim Kendell Cook.</span></p><h3><b>Is 90 Day Fiance’s Michael Baltimore On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span>We didn’t find Michael Baltimore on Instagram or any other social media.</span></p><h3><b>90 Day Fiance’s Michael Baltimore Height</b></h3><p><span>Michael Baltimore stands tall at a height of 6 feet (183 cm).</span></p><p><span>Mentioning his district features, Michael has blue eyes, dark hair, and a fit body.</span></p><h3><b>Michael Baltimore [90 Day Fiance] Family</b></h3><p><span>Michael comes from a family of at least six.</span></p><p><span>His parents are Viola M Rooks and Michael A Baltimore Sr. They were 62 and 64 years of age respectively in 2023.</span></p><p><span>As for his siblings, Michael’s sister Shanelle Baltimore lived in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. She is a </span><i><span>John Harris</span></i><span> graduate who turned 46 in August 2022. Here’s her IG @</span><a href=#><span>mz.bmore76</span></a><span> and FB @</span><a href=#><span>shanelle.baltimore.9</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, Shanelle lost her son Hauson K. Baltimore-Green Jr. at age the age of 18 in Jan 2014. Also, it seems she lost her daughter Keeron Greene before Hauson.</span></p><p><span>Likewise, Michael’s sister, Maurice A Baltimore has long passed away.</span></p><p><span>Besides them, Michael also has a sister named Briona Baltimore (born: December 1995).</span></p><h4><b>Related FAQs</b></h4><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is 90 Day Fiance’s Michael Baltimore From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Michael hails from Harrisburg, PA</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>When Is 90 Day Fiance’s Michael Baltimore Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Michael celebrates his birthday on September 16 and is of the Virgo zodiac.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmpqGTna6muIybmKWsmaK8s7GMcmdmnJGueqe1wKeanmWnnrOmedahpmavkah6qbGMnZitoZ6cfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./morgan-stewart-on-her-celeb-worn-tla-athleisure-line.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Morgan Stewart on Her Celeb-Worn TLA Athleisure Line">&larr;
