She doesn’t talk much about her parents, so little is known about them – she attended John Dewey High School in Brooklyn, Pacifica Graduate Institute with a Masters’s in Clinical Psychology, and received her Ph.D. in 2015. She is currently <strong>55 years old</strong>.</p><h2>How Tall Is Nadine Caridi?

Professional Life</h2><p>Nadine began her modeling career as the poster girl for “Miller Lite” beer, and she went on to appear in numerous national campaigns. Still, she wasn’t nearly as famous after she began dating Jordan Belfort. Her celebrity didn’t bring her much because she stopped modeling as soon as she married Jordan.</p><p>Nadine has worked as a marriage counselor and family therapist under Dr. Nadine Macaluso since she received her Ph.D. in 2015. She claims that ‘therapy is a path of self-discovery that can reconnect you to your authentic self, allowing you to feel fully alive and reach your potential.’</p><h2>Who Did Nadine Caridi Date? Relationship And Affairs</h2><p>Nadine met Jordan at one of his parties, and it was her then-boyfriend, American entrepreneur and semi-professional race driver Alan Wilzig, who introduced the two – Jordan was famous back then for throwing parties full of girls, alcohol, and drugs. He was married to Deniso Lombardo at the time, but he was very attracted to Nadine, and he married her in 1991, a few years after they divorced. She then quit her modeling job and has two children with him: Carter, a son, and Chandler, a daughter.</p><p>Jordan purchased a luxurious yacht for his wife, which he named “Nadine,” but it sank in June 1996. Jordan was frequently in the news at the time due to his suspicious businesses, which prompted an investigation by authorities, and he was sentenced to four years in prison in 2003 – he spent one year and ten months in jail before being released on probation for good behavior. This incident, along with Jordan’s alcohol and drug addiction, affairs with other women, and physical abuse of Nadine, led to her decision to divorce him in 2005.</p><h2>Nadine Caridi Net Worth 2023</h2><p>According to authoritative sources, <strong>Nadine’s net worth is around $3 million as of November 2023</strong>, the majority of which she has earned through her career as a therapist.</p><h2>Social Media</h2><p>Nadine has her own website where she offers her therapist services, and she also has an Instagram account with nearly 9,000 followers and over 1,000 posts – she mostly posts pictures with motivational quotes, and many people have claimed that Nadine has helped them with their problems. She is also very active on Twitter, where she opened an account in June 2012 and has less than 1,000 followers and around 1,000 tweets.</p><h2>Facts</h2><li>Her lucky number is 8.</li><li>Her lucky color is purple.</li><li>She likes to cook.</li><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Ex-wife</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGilmpyZo7Jur8CroJ2hXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./january-20-2024-pbs-news-weekend-full-episode-1705767429.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="PBS NewsHour | Season 2024 | January 20, 2024 - PBS News Weekend full episode">&larr;
