In 1960, paving the way to a title game triumph for the Lombardi Packers, he was chosen first-team All-Pro and earned MVP respect.</span></li><li><span>Why he was Overlooked: Van Brocklin Jr. was an excellent quarterback, but he got lost in the shuffle a bit behind some of his peers from that era.</span></li><li><span>Playing Style: Van Brocklin, known for his passing skills and leadership on the field, had a profound impact, helping these teams win several games.</span></li></ul><h2><b>2.

He won three championships—his Super Bowl title came in IV, after the 1969 season—and played until he was no longer a kid by NFL standards at 40.</span></li><li><span>Why he was Overlooked: Dawson's statistics and accomplishments are more impressive than they sound, but he frequently gets shortened to be clarified on NFL history for reasons that still aren't entirely clear.</span></li><li><span>Playing Style and Impact: Dawson's accuracy in passing Architected his team to wins, which greatly impacted the game.</span></li></ul><h2><b>3. Fran Tarkenton</b></h2><ul><li><span>Years Played: 1961-1978Teams: Minnesota Vikings, New York Giants</span></li><li><span>Career Overview: Tarkenton started all 18 seasons he played in the NFL and threw for over 47,000 yards with three trips to the NFC Championship Game.</span></li><li><span>Why Overlooked: Tarkenton started in the league forever and was consistently good, but his 0-3 record in Super Bowls is more memorable.</span></li><li><span>Playing style and impact: Tark was unlike anyone, really kind of Eli before there was Eli times a million as far as knowing the game, but with much better tools.</span></li></ul><h2><b>4. Warren Moon</b></h2><ul><li><span>Years Played: 1984-2000 Teams Stats: Oilers, Vikings, Seahawks (x2), and Chiefs.</span></li><li><span>Moon Recorded an 8-16 record as a starter during his rookie season.

Troy Aikman</b></h2><ul><li><span>Years Played and Teams: 1989-2000Team(s): Dallas Cowboys</span></li><li><span>Aikman Career Overview: A field general through and trough, standing well over six feet tall in the pocket with a big arm that led Dallas to 3 Super Bowl wins.</span></li><li><span><span data-mce-fragment=1>Playing Style and Impact:</span> Aikman was the vital, calming presence and leader that kept the Cowboys at elite status for most of his career.</span></li></ul><h2><b>7.

Ben Roethlisberger</b></h2><ul><li><span>Years and Teams: 2004-Present; Pittsburgh Steelers</span></li><li><span>Overview: Big Ben has put together an impressive career filled with highs and lows, not only winning Super Bowls but putting up great numbers when he's been healthy.</span></li><li><span>Why he was Overlooked: Roethlisberger's recognition often comes with a certain tint for myriad reasons, from his team playing style to his suitability in the same era as other high-profile quarterbacks.</span></li><li><span><span data-mce-fragment=1>Playing Style and Impact:</span> Roethlisberger's toughness greatly impacts his ability to lead the Steelers to big victories.</span></li></ul><h2><b>9. John Elway</b></h2><ul><li><span>Years Played: 16 (1983-1998) Team: Denver Broncos</span></li><li><span>Summary: Elway enjoyed a largely successful career in the NFL, winning consecutive Super Bowls with the Broncos in 1997 and '98.</span></li><li><span>Why he was Overlooked: Elway was evaluated in his career from many perspectives, which factored into his not being higher on the list of all-time great quarterbacks.</span></li><li><span><span data-mce-fragment=1>Playing Style and Impact:&nbsp;</span>John Elway was integral to the game because of his ability and the locker force behind the Broncos' streaks of success.</span></li></ul><h2><b>10.

Their talents, accomplishments, and influence on the game are worth celebrating while pegged as unsung heroes of NFL lore. We must reconsider the merits of their contributions and appreciate them for forever changing professional football.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miln6RfqbWmedOop2ZpYGK6sL%2FTZqavnaKhvLC3xJ1kqq2Rp8GmvsGamqSrXaSzbq3LpWStoZ2a</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./green-golden-retriever-puppy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Golden Retriever Puppy With Green Fur Was Just Born In Florida">&larr;
