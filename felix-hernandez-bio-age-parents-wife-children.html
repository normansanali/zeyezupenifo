This remarkable accomplishment occurred during a 1–0 victory against the Tampa Bay Rays at Safeco Field. Importantly, this game marked the first-ever perfect game in the history of the Seattle Mariners franchise. His perfect game retained its status as the most recent in Major League Baseball until Domingo Germán’s perfect game in 2023.</p><p>Continuing his string of achievements, <a href=# rel=noopener>Hernández</a> set a record on April 23, 2016, for the most strikeouts by a Mariners pitcher. During the game, he struck out Rafael Ortega of the Los Angeles Angels, marking his 2,163rd strikeout as a Mariner pitcher. This surpassing of the previous record of 2,162 strikeouts, held by Randy Johnson, showcased Hernández’s prowess on the field.</p><p>Hernández’s journey began in Valencia, Venezuela, where he was born. Impressed by Hernández’s pitching abilities even at that age, Fuenmayor recommended him to fellow scouts Pedro Avila and Emilio Carrasquel. The Seattle Mariners wasted no time and signed Hernández as soon as he turned 16, adhering to MLB regulations.</p><p>After completing his high school education, Hernández eventually embraced his first professional contract. On July 4, 2002, Bob Engle, the Mariners’ director of international operations, secured Hernández’s commitment as a nondrafted free agent. The signing came with a substantial bonus of $710,000, even though Hernández mentioned that other teams offered higher sums. Among the interested teams were the New York Yankees and the Atlanta Braves, both of which reportedly proposed more lucrative offers than Seattle.</p><p>Hernández’s decision to join the Mariners was influenced in part by his admiration for fellow Venezuelan pitcher Freddy García, who was part of the team at that time. His father, Félix Sr., who managed negotiations, also played a role in the decision. The relationship cultivated between Engle and the Mariners’ scouts and Hernández’s family fostered trust and facilitated the process.</p><p>Furthermore, Hernández proudly represented his home country, Venezuela, in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. He showcased his pitching talents during the tournament, contributing to his nation’s performance. Additionally, Hernández participated in the 2017 World Baseball Classic, continuing his involvement on the international stage.</p><p>Hernández’s distinctive pitching style involved an array of pitches, including a sinker (two-seam fastball), a slider, a changeup, and a curveball. While his fastball’s velocity decreased from his initial MLB debut, his years of experience transformed him into a more strategic and efficient pitcher. In 2016, his pitch averages included a sinker at around 90–92 mph, a four-seam fastball at a similar speed range, a slider at 84–86 mph, a curveball at 79–81 mph, and a changeup at 87–88 mph. He occasionally incorporated a cut fastball around 88–90 mph. His changeup, frequently used during two-strike situations, boasted the highest whiff rate among his pitches.</p><p>Hernández’s best performances often showcased his ability to induce groundball outs and strikeouts while minimizing airborne hits. A prime example was his perfect game, during which he permitted only five batted balls to leave the infield. After the third inning, no balls made it out of the infield except for one flyout by Ben Zobrist. In contrast, he secured eight groundouts and an impressive twelve strikeouts.</p><p>Interestingly, Hernández sported a long-sleeved undershirt beneath his uniform jersey, even in the hottest weather. While this choice is commonly made by pitchers to prevent their arms from cooling down, Hernández’s motivation was to prevent perspiration from affecting his grip on the baseball.</p><p>Félix Hernández’s baseball journey is marked by a series of exceptional achievements, a diverse array of pitches, and a dedicated commitment to his craft.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Félix Hernández Age</h2><p>As of August 2023, he was 37 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Félix Hernández Parents</h2><p>His parents are Félix Hernández Sr., and Mirian Hernández.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Félix Hernández Wife</h2><p>He is married to Sandra Hernandez.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Félix Hernández Children</h2><p>His children are Jeremy Hernández, and Mia Hernández.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Félix Hernández Net Worth</h2><p>His net worth is nothing short of $50 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jp%2BcpaGoYrWmvs2apZ2dqmKvqruMmp6eZaCWv6a606xksKGWmnqktMilm6udnmQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./analyzing-b450-for-amd-ryzen-a-quick-look-at-all-the-motherboards.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="GIGABYTE B450 Aorus Pro and B450 Aorus Pro WIFI">&larr;
