Quarterbacks who excel at leading their teams to victory in these critical moments are highly regarded for their clutch performances.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Jalen Hurts' College Career</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Jalen Hurts' journey to becoming a successful quarterback began during his college days. He started his career at the University of Alabama, where he showcased his skills and leadership abilities. Hurts had a remarkable freshman season, leading the Crimson Tide to an impressive 14-1 record and earning himself the SEC Offensive Player of the Year award. During his time at Alabama, he engineered several game-winning drives, displaying his composure and ability to perform under pressure.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Jalen Hurts in the NFL</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>After an illustrious college career, Jalen Hurts made the transition to the NFL when he was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft. In his rookie season, Hurts served as the backup quarterback behind Carson Wentz. However, due to inconsistent performances from Wentz, Hurts was given the opportunity to showcase his skills as the starting quarterback towards the end of the season.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>During his rookie campaign, Jalen Hurts displayed his ability to lead game-winning drives in the NFL as well. Despite the limited number of starts, Hurts managed to engineer two game-winning drives for the Eagles. These drives not only showcased his potential but also provided a glimpse into his ability to thrive in pressure situations.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Impact on Team Success</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The number of game-winning drives a quarterback has is often seen as a testament to their ability to lead their team to victory. In the case of Jalen Hurts, although he has a relatively small sample size due to his recent entry into the NFL, his game-winning drives have already made a significant impact on the Philadelphia Eagles.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The ability to engineer game-winning drives not only demonstrates a quarterback's skill set but also provides a boost of confidence to the team. It shows that they can rely on their quarterback to perform when the game is on the line. This level of trust can have a ripple effect on the entire team, motivating them to perform at their best and giving them the belief that they can overcome any obstacle.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Jalen Hurts has already showcased his ability to lead game-winning drives both in college and the NFL. Despite his limited experience at the professional level, Hurts has already engineered multiple game-winning drives for the Philadelphia Eagles. As he continues to develop as a quarterback, it is likely that his tally of game-winning drives will increase, further solidifying his status as a clutch performer.
