thunder, in the Marvel cinematic universe.&nbsp;He first played the role in the 2011 film,&nbsp;</span><span>Thor</span><span>&nbsp;and has reprized the role in many other films such as&nbsp;</span><span>The Avengers</span><span>&nbsp;(2012),&nbsp;</span><span>Thor: The Dark World</span><span>&nbsp;(2013),&nbsp;</span><span>Avengers: Age of

Chris.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-hemsworth-bio-age></span><strong><span>Chris Hemsworth Bio (Age)</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Christopher Hemsworth was born on August 11, 1983 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.&nbsp;He is an Australian national of diverse ethnicity with German, Scottish, Dutch, English and Irish ancestry.&nbsp;Hemsworth spent his formative years in Melbourne as well as in a remote part of Australia known as The Outback.&nbsp;For his college education he attended Heathmonth College.</span></p><p><span>Chris Hemsworth began his film career in his native Australia, where he appeared in various television series.&nbsp;They include&nbsp;</span><span>Guinevere Jones</span><span>&nbsp;(2002),&nbsp;</span><span>Neighbors</span><span>&nbsp;(2002) and&nbsp;</span><span>Marshall</span><span>&nbsp;(2002).&nbsp;He got his first big break in 2004 when he landed the role of sexy but troubled Kim Hyde on the long-running Australian soap.&nbsp;</span><span>home and away</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;The soap had previously served as a launch pad for the careers of other Australian actors and Hemsworth was no different.&nbsp;After a three-year stint on the show, he left for Hollywood in 2007.</span></p><span>It was in Tinseltown that he landed roles in films such as&nbsp;</span><span>Star Trek</span><span>&nbsp;(2009) and&nbsp;</span><span>The Perfect Getaway</span><span>&nbsp;(2010).&nbsp;He finally joined the big leagues in 2010 when he landed the popular role of Thor.&nbsp;He didn’t even expect to land the role due to a bad audition.&nbsp;In fact, his name hasn’t made the list of the last four players in the race.&nbsp;It was someone urging director Ken Branagh to give him another chance.&nbsp;Branagh did, and the rest, as they say, is history.&nbsp;Hemsworth has become one of Hollywood’s biggest stars.&nbsp;He has also won several awards and recognitions.</span><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=his-capital></span><strong><span>His capital</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Chris Hemsworth has a net worth of between $70-$90 million.&nbsp;In 2018 alone, he earned $64.5 million, according to Forbes.&nbsp;His wealth comes from his successful film career as well as hefty endorsement deals.&nbsp;Hemsworth has certainly come a long way from a humble childhood in which he had to save up for months to afford a surfboard.&nbsp;Among his many possessions is a six bedroom mansion in Byron Bay, Australia.&nbsp;The mansion offers luxuries like a gym, steam room, spa, games room, media room, and other cool things.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section

Tristan and Sasha (born March 2014).&nbsp;Hemsworth has publicly expressed his hope that his children won’t grow up spoiled just because they have rich and famous parents.</span></p><p><span>Chris
