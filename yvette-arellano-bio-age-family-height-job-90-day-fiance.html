Premiered on 17 April 2022, the No. 1 unscripted show on TLC introduced seven (mostly) new couples aiming to make it to the altar. Yvette Arellano, whom we shall tell you all about in the rest of the writing, appeared on the reality show with Mohamed Abdelhamed, her much younger fiance from Egypt. Did Yvette ultimately find her happily ever after with a suitor from across the border? Find out below.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>90 Day Fiance: Are Yvette Arellano And Mohamed Abdelhamed Still Together?</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Despite appearing very much in love, Yvette Arellano and Mohamed Abdelhamed were seen facing major differences as they tried to sort out their relationship within three months on the TLC show.</p><p>Be that as it may, the 1st of January 2022 saw the couple’s very sweet interaction on Facebook. Mohamad took to his Facebook a picture of them together and wrote “Happy new year for my beautiful 👸👑❣️😍🎊🎉 wishing to spend every year together ❣️❤️” for its caption. Then, in the comment box,&nbsp;Yvette reciprocated his feelings with “I love you so much Mohamed Abdelhamed ❣️ I’m so excited to make all our dreams come true, beside you💞♾💞.” The last one to end the to and fro was Mohamed. Positive about their future together, he had chimed in “In’sha’Allah every dream will come true ❤️❤️.”</p><p>However, since the release of their story on 90 Day Fiance, fans anticipated plenty of problems for the couple. Viewers especially seemed skeptical about their age gap and therefore were not as hopeful about Yvette and Mohamed’s future.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Yvette Arellano Age</strong></h3><p>Because Yvette Arellano was born in the year 1973, she turned 48 years old in 2021. This makes her nearly twice old than 25 years old Mohamed.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Yvette Arellano Job</strong></h3><p>Yvette Arellano is dually trained as a Doctor of Oriental Medicine (DOM) and Licensed Massage Therapist (LMT), and has joined the Mountain Spirit medical team as an advanced practitioner.

It is in fact because of her love for fitness that she crossed paths with her “90 Day” fiance. Mohamed revealed in an episode that he was browsing social media when he suddenly came across Yvette’s profile. He recalled being quite infatuated with her. Then, once Mohamed discovered her affinity for fitness, he used that as an ice breaker and messaged her directly. Yvette responded quickly to the message, and the rest is history.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Yvette Arellano Family</strong></h3><p>Yvette’s dad Norman Fisher Arellano passed away peacefully on 20 January 2014, with likely his family by his side in Salt Lake City. He is survived by his wife, Yvette’s mom, Anna Arellano of Elko. They were married for 36 years and during those time, they had four kids. Including Yvette, there are&nbsp;Norman Immanuel Arellano, Danielle Bisenieks (married to James) of Albuquerque, Eddie Joe Rodriguez (married to Miranda) of Salt Lake City, and Nickolas Arellano of Elko. Of them, Norman turned 53 in 2021 and before that he tied the knot in July 2017.</p><p>Most importantly, Yvette also is a mother, likely a single mother. She has a 12-year-old son with special needs. In 2010, her son was born with Down Syndrome, Autism, and Stage 2 Kidney Disease.</p><p>Yvette shares the young one with her ex-husband and is extremely dedicated to her duties as a mother.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li style=text-align:left><h4><strong>Where Is Yvette Arellano From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Yvette Arellano was born and bred in her hometown of Silver City, New Mexico.
