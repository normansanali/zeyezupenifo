He is also famous for his appearance in the television show “Lizzie McGuire.” However, he is most known as the son of Steven Tyler, the lead singer of the Boston-based rock band Aerosmith.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve rose to prominence in the 1970s, and fans adore him for his wide vocal range and on-stage acrobatics. However, the 1970s also marked the fall of the iconic singer. Steve struggled with heavy drug and alcohol addiction which affected the band. After completing his rehabilitation, the band once again rose to prominence.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though Taj Monroe Tallarico is in the entertainment industry like his father, he prefers to stay behind the scenes. Here’s everything we know about the iconic rockstar’s son.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/photo_2023-06-14_09-41-56-fotor-2023061494428.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Steven_Tylers_Son></span>Who Is Steven Tyler’s Son?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Taj Monroe Tallarico was born on January 31, 1991, to Steven Tyler and his ex-wife, Teresa Barrick. He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, and grew up with his parents. The celebrity child is an American with mixed ethnicity due to his rich cultural heritage of Italian, German, African-American, and Ukrainian roots.&nbsp;</p><p>While many celebrity children bask in the spotlight due to their parent’s fame, Taj enjoys living under the radar. Consequently, he hasn’t disclosed much about his childhood and what it felt like growing up as the only son of an icon.</p><p>Additionally, there are no details regarding his educational background and educational achievements. However, reports suggest he attended one of the best schools in Boston, considering his father’s status.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/photo_2023-06-14_09-41-27-fotor-2023061494531.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Sisters_Does_Taj_Monroe_Tallarico_Have></span>How Many Sisters Does Taj Monroe Tallarico Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While Taj is the only son of the rockstar, he is not the only child. <a href=#>Steven Tyler’s kids</a> are Liv, Mia Tallarico, Chelsea, and Taj Tyler.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>First is Mia Tyler; she was born on December 22, 1978, at the Alice Peck Day Hospital in Lebanon, New Hampshire. Mia is also an actress and model. Mia is also the only child Steve had with his first wife, actress Cyrinda Foxe. Her parents tied the knot in 1978 and parted ways in 1987, after which her mom died of a brain tumor in 2002. She is Taj’s first half-sister.&nbsp;</p><p>Next is Chelsea Tyler. Following his divorce from Cyrinda Foxe, Steve tied the knot with clothing designer Teresa Barrick on May 28, 1988, in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The former couple welcomed their first child and daughter, Chelsea, in 1989. Like Taj, there is little information about his sister Chelsea. However, she is Taj Monroe Tallarico’s only full sibling.&nbsp;</p><p>Last is Liv Tyler, an American model and actress. Liv was born on July 1, 1997, at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York City. She is the only daughter of her mom, Bebe Buell, a former Playboy Playmate, and Steven Tyler. She is the product of the brief relationship between Steve and the former model. Hence, she is Taj’s second half-sister.&nbsp;</p><p>It is unknown if the famous rockstar’s kids have a close bond. However, their father is attached to them. He praises them every chance and calls them the “wolf pack.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/photo_2023-06-14_09-41-44-fotor-2023061494321.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Taj_Monroe_Tallarico_Career></span>Taj Monroe Tallarico Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Taj Monroe Tallarico followed his father’s footsteps into entertainment. However, he isn’t a performer like his father but a music producer. The celebrity child is gradually making a name for himself in the music industry and has reportedly worked with several prominent artists. Watching his father make music as a kid influenced his career choice.&nbsp;</p><p>Asides from being a music producer, Taj Monroe Tallarico has also worked as an actor. In 2002 the celebrity child starred in an episode of “Lizzie McGuire,” an American comedy TV series. Taj featured in the series alongside his sister, Chelsea. Although the Tyler siblings played minor roles in the series, they both decided acting was not the way to go for them.&nbsp;</p><p>Since his brief acting career came to an end, Taj has since pursued music. According to reports, he is a prolific songwriter who has written for some big names in the music industry. However, Taj has been private about his career and achievements. Hence, there are no details regarding any collaborations he has done.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/photo_2023-06-14_09-41-39-fotor-202306149468.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Taj_Monroe_Tallarico_in_a_Relationship></span>Is Taj Monroe Tallarico in a Relationship?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, he is. While Taj prefers to keep things private, his siblings don’t. The music producer is married to Brittany Reardon; the couple reportedly started dating in 2016. Eventually, they tied the knot in October 2018 in a very private wedding ceremony. Their wedding was so intimate that they didn’t share their pictures online.</p><p>The public only got wind of their wedding when Taj’s sisters took to their socials to congratulate the then-new couple. Like Taj, there is little information about his wife. The couple has successfully kept their marriage away from the media, and there has not been any record of scandals in their marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Taj Monroe Tallarico is on his way to becoming successful in the music industry, the music producer doesn’t want the fame that comes with it. Like Morris Chestnut’s son, <a href=#>Grant Chestnut</a>, he loves living away from the spotlight.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kwaK2jKamp6qfmnq1rculmKuhk6R6rrHErWSsrJWrsq9507KjnqqjYsCwuo4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-dr-allison-arwady-wikipedia.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Dr. Allison Arwady?
