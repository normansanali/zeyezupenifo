She showed some more of her range when she was cast as the edgy and headstrong character Mal in the Disney film, Descendants. By 2015, she made her debut as a music artist with the soundtrack album for Liv and Maddie. In the same year, “If Only,” her debut single for Descendants, was released. She also ventured into Broadway, gaining positive reviews for her performances in Hairspray Live! and Clueless: The Musical.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>As of 2022, Cameron has deleted all of her existing music — including her 2019 EP Bloodshot/Waste — from all music platforms and has chosen to start again on a clean slate. She has also been cast as Bubbles in The CW’s upcoming live-action adaptation of the popular animated show The Powerpuff Girls. While the show has hit several roadblocks, including the network’s rejection of the pilot, Cameron revealed to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ComicBook.com</a> earlier this year that things were moving in the right direction.</p><p>“Powerpuff is such a high concept show, and the way we wanted to do it was so high concept, that there were 99 ways it could have gone wrong, and one way it could have gone right. And I think we were close, but we didn’t nail it. That’s for a number of reasons. I remember them calling me and being like, ‘This is how it ended up, and this is what we would rather do,’ and I was like, ‘Yeah, I can’t even be mad about that. That’s fair. Let’s do that, then.’ I think they really just want to get it right.”</p><p data-characters=129 data-current-count=129 data-injectable=false>Fans can catch Cameron on Apple TV Plus’ musical comedy Schmigadoon!, which will hopefully be renewed for a second season soon.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Joey Bragg (Joey Rooney)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Joey Bragg (@joeybragg)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=554 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>Before he gained recognition for his role as Joey Rooney, Joey Bragg was cast in the 2012 film Freddie 3: Camp Fred as Peter Mago.
