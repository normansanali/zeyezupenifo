At the top of the 13th, Pat, a relief pitcher, hit the run that won the game.

Before the draft, “Sports Illustrated,” “ESPN,” and “NFL Draft Scout” all said that he was the second-best quarterback.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He was one of the most wanted players in the draft because of how well he did in college.

But I thought this was important enough to say, so I did.</p><p style=text-align:justify>I couldn’t just sit back and worry about getting my next contract; I had to use my platform to help. It’s not always about money. Not about being famous. It comes down to doing the right thing.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Soon after that, he joined NBA star LeBron James’s organization, More than a Vote, and helped with voter registration and efforts to keep people from voting.
