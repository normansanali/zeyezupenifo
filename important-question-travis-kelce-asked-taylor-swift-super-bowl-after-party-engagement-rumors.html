He couldn't accompany her much in the past few months, because he couldn't really leave the country during the season, so he wasn't able cheer her on as much as she did him. But that's about to change.</p><p><strong>Taylor Swift is now embarking on another leg of her Eras tour, and Travis will be joining her on the journey.</strong> "After the Super Bowl, Travis will be joining Taylor on her tour and traveling with her," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source shared a few days ago</a>.
