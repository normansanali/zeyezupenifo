Who is Lex Luger dating now & how much money does Lex Luger have?</p><h2>Lex Luger Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Lex Luger</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Music Producer</strong> who was born on <strong>March 6, 1991</strong> in Suffolk, Virginia, <strong>United States</strong>. Renowned producer with a distinctive style who produced tracks for artists like <a href=#>Kanye West</a>, <a href=#>Jay-Z</a>, <a href=#>Slim Thug</a>, and <a href=#>Rick Ross</a>.</p><p>He first gained national attention for his production on the track Hard in the Paint, which was a collaboration with <a href=#>Waka Flocka Flame</a>.</p><p>Initially spending long days experimenting with Fruity Loops and working every day after school and all day every weekend wasn’t enough to jumpstart Luger’s production career. He dropped out of King’s Fork High School after the 10th grade to further hone his music production talents when he realized that he was able to produce song length instrumentals at a fast pace. Putting hours into honing his craft, Luger began to dramatically increase his musical output after he found that he could knock out at least 10 beats a day. He then started hearing about independent music artists gaining exposure through MySpace and started posting music on that website. Around late 2008, he began cold-emailing his beats to various rappers and posting instrumentals on his Myspace page, hoping to gain further exposure in the hip hop industry. In 2009, a then unknown rapper by the name of Waka Flocka Flame began e-mailing him back. The two later built a relationship on MySpace when Luger began sending Waka beats once every few days.</p><p>Waka expressed interest in Luger’s production style when he requested a particularly vicious beat that he wanted to rap over. Luger sent Waka 40 beats, where three beats eventually ended on Waka’s 2009, ‘Salute Me or Shoot Me 2’ mixtape. Waka later requested some more from Luger to which he responded with hundreds more, and eventually Waka Flocka Flame flew him out to Atlanta to collaborate with him. Spending months sequestered in a basement with no internet access in Atlanta working with Waka Flocka Flame, Luger laid much of the production groundwork for Waka’s debut album. Not knowing the future outcome of his career, Luger contemplated taking a second job stacking boxes in a warehouse to support his production career. Waka later gained fame and was eventually signed to Bricksquad when his song O Lets Do It became a hit.</p><p align=justify>He was born in Suffolk, Virginia and later moved to Atlanta, Georgia.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lex Luger</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lex</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Luger</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Music Producer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 6</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1991</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Suffolk</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virginia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Peggy Fulbright (m. 1981–2003)</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Lauren Ashley Pfohl, Brian Pfohl</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Lex Luger ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
