He immediately became one an global star, with chart-topping singles like "<a href=# rel>GUMMO</a>" and collaborations with hitmakers like <a href=# class=text-word rel>Kanye West</a>. Also, 6ix9ine is popular for some of his tracks like "Fefe," "Kooda," and "Gotti."&nbsp;</p><p>6ix9ine distinguishes himself from other rappers through the way he raps and acts. This makes it easy for him to rise to the top. However, he lost a lot of money when he breached the law. So, how rich is the rapper? What is his current net worth? This guide will inform you about 6ix9ine's net worth, prison term, personal life, and career.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6ix9ine-s-biography>6ix9ine's Biography</h2></span><p>PHILADELPHIA, PA - SEPTEMBER 01: Tekashi 6ix9ine attends the 2018 Made In America Festival - Day 1 at Benjamin Franklin Parkway on September 1, 2018 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Roc Nation)</p><p>Depending on who you ask, Tekashi 6ix9ine's net worth ranges from $500,000 to $10 million. Daniel Hernandez is a native New Yorker who grew up with a difficult childhood. When he was younger, he found a job and also peddled narcotics to help support his mother. He attended Public School 59 for elementary, Juan Morel Campos for middle school, and Legacy High School for high school. Yet, he did not complete high school. In fact, he was expelled from eighth grade for being a lousy student.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Family Life</h2></span><p>At the age of 18, he<a href=# rel> and Sara Molina</a> had a daughter named Saraiya Hernandez. After that, he began dating Marlayna M., with whom he had a daughter named Briella Iris Hernandez. One of the reasons 6ix9ine’s net worth has also reduced is that he has children to care for. The second child of 6ix9ine was kept a secret until Marlayna sent a letter to the judge about her. "On November 19th 2018 I gave birth to our daughter [redacted] during my induced labor I was alarmed with the information that Daniel had been arrested. More than anything I wanted him to be there as I only had a very caring women from a pregnancy organization by my side," Marlayna wrote at the time.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6ix9ine-s-career>6ix9ine’s Career</h2></span><p>6ix9ine loves the rap star life, but he had to work many low-wage jobs before breaking into the music industry. He worked at various places to assist his mother in earning money. He began his career by releasing rap tracks in 2014. After he put out "GUMMO," 6ix9ine's career took off. He released songs like "69," "Pimpin," "4769," and "Who the Hell Is You" in a succession. All these <a href=# rel>songs in his early career </a>greatly increased his net worth.</p><p>Furthermore, 6ix9ine's only mixtape, Day69, was released in 2018. This mixtape was a tremendous hit and received a lot of positive feedback. He was also embroiled in a major dispute the same year when his and Casanova's entourages were involved in a shooting. Nevertheless, in June 2018, he re-released "Fefe," this time with <a href=# class=text-word rel>Nicki Minaj</a> and Murda Beatz. The song was a worldwide smash, peaking at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in its first week.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-run-ins-with-the-law>Run-Ins With The Law</h2></span><p>Tekashi 6ix9ine backstage (Photo by Swan Gallet/WWD/Penske Media via Getty Images)</p><p>6ix9ine was arrested at the end of 2018 on charges of racketeering, possessing weapons, and conspiracy to murder. This was part of an ongoing investigation into the <a href=# rel>Nine Trey Gangsters</a> criminal gang. Tekashi69's celebrity, however, did not keep him out of conflict with the authorities. He faced upwards of 47 years in prison but struck a plea deal. It obliged him to testify against his co-defendants or "snitch on" them. In exchange for telling on other gang members, a federal judge cut the sentence to only two years. In late 2019, he began serving his sentence.</p><p>The judge released the rapper four months shy of completing his prison sentence because of the rise of COVID-19. Additionally, 6ix9ine has been detained several times and charged with various offences as a result of his poor behaviour. In 2015, he was arrested for having an underage girl perform sex acts on video. He was also reportedly arrested in 2018 for choking someone in a Houston mall. The latter charges were dimissed, but it didn't stop 6ix9ine's infamy from rising.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-discography>Discography</h2></span><p>6ix9ine is an artist who releases music at the drop of a dime. Because he's unpredictable, his discography is lengthy with releases that have stormed the internet. Despite his controversial role in pop culture, he continues to rake in cash and amass more fans. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has certified nine of his singles as platinum and two as gold. This achievement has paved way for him in that industry and it has had a large effect on his net worth.</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via][</a><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">]</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaoJ2hZVmrqGZpGK2tHmVoq9yoZ6awG66xK1ksKeiqbU%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./will-throwing-up-help-acid-reflux-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Will Throwing Up Help Acid Reflux? - Exploring the Effectiveness of Vomiting as a Remedy">&larr;
