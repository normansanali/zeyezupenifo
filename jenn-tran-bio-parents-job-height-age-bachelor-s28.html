Joey Graziadei was announced as the lead for the season in August 2023, and just lately Reality Steve, revealed that its filming officially began on 19 September 2023. Like old times, Joey meets 32 women in the show, and by the end of the night, he sends 10 of them out the door. One of these women is Jenn Tran and so in the rest of the writing, we shall explore her.</p><p>Before we proceed, let us also remind you to mark your calendar as the season of The Bachelor will debut on 22 January 2024.</p><h3><strong>Jenn Tran On Bachelor Season 28 aka Joey Graziadei Season</strong></h3><p>The Bachelor Season 28 spoilers we know so far show that by the fifth episode, only 12 women remain in the show while filming in Spain. This includes Jenn Tran. So, does she also end up becoming the only one remaining in the competition?</p><p>During the sixth rose ceremony, the show’s bachelor sends home Jessica Edwards, Lea Canyanan, Katelyn DeBacker, and Lexi Young. That leaves six women in the running for Joey’s heart: Kelsey Toussant, Maria Georgas, Rachel Nance, Kelsey Anderson, Daisy Kent, and of course Jenn Tran.</p><p>Joey and the six ladies then arrive in Jasper, Alberta, Canada, and they stay at the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge, where according to Reality Steve, they have a Polar Plunge date, on 21 October 2023.</p><p>Further, it is also been spilled that Joey’s final four women competing during hometown dates are Daisy Kent, Kelsey Anderson, Maria Georgas, Rachel Nance, and not Jenn.</p><p>You should also know that The Bachelor this season is predicted to eliminate Maria at the rose ceremony before heading off to Mexico for Fantasy Suite week. Then, after spending some time with the final three ladies, Steve claims that Joey sends Rachel packing. In the end, Joey chooses Daisy Kent and they get engaged. So, according to all that has been outed, it is not Jenn but Daisy who manages to steal Joey from all. According to Steve, Jenn only gets to be the fifth runner-up and is eliminated in Canada, making Kelsey Toussant the sixth runner-up.</p><p>That is not all! Reality Steve also exposed during an episode of his podcast, that the villain of Joey’s season is Maria Georgas, the one who makes it to the final four before finally getting the boot. Steve spilled that Maria just does not get along with the other women.</p><p>Joey, if you don’t already know, is the runner-up from Charity Lawson’s season of The Bachelorette. He is originally from Pennsylvania but has since moved to Hawaii. The leading man is a tennis pro and a total family man.</p><p>Joey was one of the final four men during Charity’s season. To Bachelor Nation fans back then, Joey had spoken about his life being “absolutely heaven”, with him able to spend his days on the court and his evenings with friends watching the sunset on the beach. The only thing he was lacking was a companion. Clearly, this one particular thing remains unchanged, which is why he decided to take another plunge into ABC’s matchmaking scheme.</p><p>A video clip from the Bachelorette season also featured Joey revealing that when he was in kindergarten, his dad came out as gay. This event of his life, he recalled, made him more loving and accepting.</p><h3><strong>Jenn Tran Age</strong></h3><p>Jenn Tran was born in 1997. So, she turned 26 years old.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Jenn Tran’s Parents?</strong></h3><p>Jenn Tran unlike many of her costars from her dating reality show, did not seem to like the idea of putting everything about herself out in the public, including her family background. So, at this point, almost no one knows who her parents are or what they are called.</p><h3><strong>Jenn Tran Height</strong></h3><p>Beautiful Jenn Tran stands below 5’3” in height.</p><h3><strong>Jenn Tran Job</strong></h3><p>Jenn Tran has been working as a clinical care technician at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts from September 2020 until July 2022.

Even prior, Jenn also was a restaurant server at&nbsp;Food Fight Restaurant Group’s Fresco Rooftop Restaurant.</p><p>Between 2018 and 2020, Jenn studied BS in Molecular Biology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Prior, between 2016 and 2018, he went to the University of Pittsburgh.</p><p>At one point, Jenn also volunteered as an elementary school volunteer at Glendale Elementary School and Second Harvest Foodbank of Southern Wisconsin.</p><p>After a bit of research, we also found Jenn’s Amazon shops.
