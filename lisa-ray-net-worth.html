She is probably best known for her roles in Canadian films like “Water” (2005) and “I Can’t Think Straight” (2008), but has also appeared in movies of Indian production such as “Nethaji”(1994), “Kasoor”(2001), “Takkari Donga”(2002) and “Veerappan”(2016).</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Lisa Ray is? According to sources it has been estimated that Lisa Ray’s overall net worth is over $10 million, acquired through a versatile acting career spanning two continents, which she started during the ‘90s. She has appeared in films and on television, and has been involved in humanitarian work too. Since she is still an active member of the entertainment industry, her net worth continues to grow.</p><h3>Lisa Ray Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>Lisa was born to parents of an intermarriage – her father is a Bengali Hindu, while her mother is Polish. Although born in Toronto, she spent some of her childhood in Kolkata and developed her love for cinematography by watching movies of Satyajit Ray and <a href=#>Federico Fellini</a> with her father. During her schooling, she was an excellent student and finished five years of high school in just four attending three high schools: Richview Collegiate Institute, Etobicoke Collegiate Institute and Silverthorn Collegiate Institute. At her final year in high school, she was offered modelling for a fashion magazine, and came to public attention after appearing in an advertisement for Bombay Dyeing. This led Lisa to the modeling industry, and a career which lasted for several years, and during which Ray appeared on numerous magazine covers, worked as a host and spokesperson.</p><p>Although she turned down several roles she was offered, Lisa finally made her Indian Film Industry debut in 2001, when she appeared in the Hindi film “Kasoor”. She was then noticed by director Deepa Mehta and was soon cast in his romantic Indian-Canadian movie “Bollywood/Hollywood”(2002), persuading Ray that she wanted to devote herself to acting more seriously, and so she moved to London to study at the Central School of Speech and Drama, The Desmond Jones School of Physical Theatre, the London Centre for Theatre Studies and BADA.</p><p>In 2004, she graduated from the Academy of Live and Recorded Arts, and the following year Lisa cooperated with Mehta once again, this time in his Oscar-nominated film “Water” and has since worked in American, Canadian and European productions. Some of her most notable roles include those in “All Hat”, “The World Unseen”, “I Can’t Think Straight”, “Kill Kill Faster Faster”, “Psych” and “Defendor”. When it comes to her more recent activity, Ray has appeared in Bollywood romantic drama film “Ishq forever” and the biographical drama film “Veerappan” in 2016.</p><p>Privately, Ray married Jason Dehni in October 2012. Lisa was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2009, and has since had a stem cell transplant and severely changed her diet. She is actively involved in bringing attention to the rights of girls around the world, and has been a fundraiser for people living with Multiple Myeloma.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=10.051446945338><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Lisa Ray</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>April 4, 1972</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Toronto, Ontario, Canada</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.63 m</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Model, Activist, Presenter, Philanthropist</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Silverthorn Collegiate Institute, Richview Collegiate Institute, Etobicoke Collegiate Institute</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Canadian, Indian</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Jason Dehni (m. 2012)</td></tr><tr readability=0.36363636363636><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/lisaraniray</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36842105263158><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/lisaraniray</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0712908</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Movies</td><td>I Can’t Think Straight 2008 The World Unseen 2007 Kasoor 2001 Veerappan 2016 Bollywood/Hollywood 2002</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>TV Shows</td><td>Murdoch Mysteries, Top Chef Canada, Endgame, The Summit</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Her cat eyes</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=33.397459442914><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=6><td>1</td><td>When asked if she is not interested in Bollywood films: "Not if I get the kind of parts Deepa offers me. I worked in one film in Bollywood but I am here, and I look forward to films being made here. I have nothing against good Bollywood films. Many are very camp and very over the top -- those films are not for me. I have lived in India for some years and am very proud of my Indian heritage."

And Canadian audiences knew that instantly. Some people have come out of the theater, telling us that Water made them think a lot about their own communities. A Greek woman told me, 'I never realized it, but we did similar things to our widows.'"

But I also knew I had to something more. I decided to go to India, and look at how the widows lived in rural areas. I even went to Varanasi. I went there pretending to be a tourist. I even had my camera! I went to the widows' homes, went to temples, heard widows sing the Radha-Krishna bhajans, and watched them for hours. I followed their body language. I was adding (from the observations) what I had read about them and from the memory of widows in my own family." (10 May 2006)</td></tr><tr readability=8.8997772828508><td>4</td><td>On how she got the role in <a href=#>Water</a> (2005): "Deepa sent me the script about two years ago. It had cheesy title like River Moon, and I was told it would be shot without any publicity in Sri Lanka, and we were not to talk about it till it was completed. As I was reading it, I knew it was Water. There was no question of rejecting it. When I remembered what had happened to Deepa in India, I became even more determined to be in the film." (10 May 2006)</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>5</td><td>"In the past, whenever I have seen myself on screen, I have felt uncomfortable so often, wondering why I reacted in a particular way in one scene, or why I didn't react in a particular way in another. But nothing of that sort happened when I saw it at the premiere. Of course, Deepa had made sure all of us did our work very well."

Watching a film in a cinema there is radically different from watching one anywhere else. And that, in turn, has informed the way films are made there. That's probably why the films are so incredibly long - it's not just about watching the film. The entire family socializes while watching the movie. (...) That's why the acting has to be so loud.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>9</td><td>When ever I'm stressed I love getting away and going home to Toronto.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>I believe in destiny.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>11</td><td>The story of my so-called affair with Sanjay Dutt came as a shock to me.
