Adin and Fousey have a pretty friendly relationship among themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>They have both streamed together before. However, fans have mixed reactions to Ross’s comment on his friend, who constantly suffers from real mental health issues.</p><p>Fousey was a very famous YouTuber back in the day before eventually succumbing to his ‘mental issues’. Furthermore, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fousey</a> has gained a significant following on YouTube, with over 10 million subscribers.&nbsp;</p><p>However, he was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">off the internet for about 4 months</a> due to his mental health issues. The YouTuber was admitted to a mental institution for several weeks before his comeback to streaming.</p><p>Fousey returned to streaming on January 2nd, just after New Year’s. He also joined Adin Ross on his stream. Adin has always been kind to Fousey. Furthermore, he also promised to give Fousey <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">100,000 dollars</a> for his struggles.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-adin-ross-and-fousey-reunite-after-fousey-s-comeback><strong>Adin Ross and Fousey reunite after Fousey’s comeback</strong></h2><p>In Adin’s January 2nd stream on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kick</a>, the streamer was joined by Fousey. Fousey’s return stream gained over 15k viewers. However, the streamer still wasn’t happy with his return, as he claimed ‘he expected better, and his expectations destroyed him’. Furthermore, he added that he could’ve done a lot better and seemed genuinely disappointed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ADIN-FOUSEY.jpg><p>Ross, on his stream, was trying to help Fousey navigate his comeback by talking to him about it. He asked Fousey to explain what was causing him to be so low. Furthermore, he presses Fousey to ‘talk to him’.&nbsp;</p><p>Fousey then points out that he is having a hard time even talking, and maybe that’s the issue. He also says to Adin that he thinks ‘he flopped’.</p><pre class=wp-block-verse>I'm gonna be honest bro, you do a lot of r*tarded shit, you are, that's what Fousey is known for bro, so, Fousey, we just want, we don't want fousey with any filter, we want ‘the Fousey’. You still have it in there. I just saw it, now I see the energy and the inspiration.</pre>Ross lamented<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Adin quickly disagrees and then tries to help out Fousey by claiming that he needs to get the ‘old Fousey’ back. In the process of motivating Fousey, Adin calls him r*tarded.</p><p>However, this doesn’t sit right with the viewers, as they think Adin is pushing him into his habits, and a real friend wouldn’t do that. Some fans also thought that Adin was encouraging him to ‘self-destruct’.</p><p>in case you missed it:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57xKynqKqkqHqvsdasZJqcmaN6s7vSrGScmZyhwG6yzq6qnrFdp7K1vsOem2annmK1qr%2BMpaCvnaOpv6atzGg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kwame-ajamu.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Moment 27 Years Of Wrongful Imprisonment Ends For Kwame Ajamu">&larr;
