Before her, Lil Durk has dated Nicole Covone and several other women whose names are not known. The rapper reportedly has 6 kids from 5 baby mamas. He had two of his kids named Angelo and Bella with Nicole, and one named Willow with India. However, the mothers of his other children; Zayden Banks, Du’mier Banks, and Skyler Banks are not known.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Lil Durk is an American rapper and the leader of the OTF (Only the Family) crew. Currently signed to Def Jam Records, Durk has been active in the industry for close to a decade and has worked with several artists in the American music industry.</p><p>The Turn Myself In rapper has braved several storms on his way to stardom, from growing up without a father in a crime-infested area to serving time in prison. Despite this, Lil Durk, who is now a father, is very determined to be there for his kids and enjoy all their special moments with them. Discover all there is to know about the rapper’s baby mama’s intrigues and his kids below.</p><h2><strong>Lil Durk’s Baby Mama and Kids</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/lil-durk-kids.png><p>The Chicago-born rapper seemingly loves a large family, and as he suggested in a past interview that he wanted to have 10 children, he seems determined to hit the number.</p><h3><strong>Lil Durk Has 6 Kids From 5 Different Women</strong></h3><p>Lil Durk is overwhelmed with lots of baby mama intrigues; he reportedly has 6 kids from 5 separate women.</p><p>His first son Angelo was born in August 2011, and his mother is Nicole Covone. Durk first started dating Covone in 2008, and they welcomed their second child, a daughter named Bella in 2013.</p><p>In that same year, the rapper welcomed his third child Zayden by an unknown woman. However, Lil Durk&nbsp;and Nicole went their separate ways not long after their second child was born.</p><p>The following year, the rapper revealed the identity of his fourth child as Du’mier Banks, and another, Skyler Banks, shortly after but neither of their mothers are known.</p><p>In 2017, Durk started dating an Instagram influencer named India Royale. The duo welcomed their first child and Durk’s baby number six (6), a daughter named Willow in 2018.</p><h2><strong>Who Is Lil Durk Dating Now?</strong></h2><p>The rapper was rumored to be dating fellow rapper Dej Loaf in early 2016 but has since debunked the claim. In 2017, he began a relationship with India Royale. He dedicated one of his 2018 singles, a love song titled India to her. The song garnered over 33 million views on YouTube and has also spawned a sequel titled, India Part II.</p><p>According to sources, Lil Durk proposed to India in September 2018, two months before she welcomed their child, Willow Banks. The couple reportedly tied the knot in a private ceremony, a month after the birth of their daughter.</p><p>The proud father of six is fond of his brood and thankful for his growing family. He tries to maintain healthy relationships with all of his kids. With four (4) kids to make up his dream number, keep your eyes and ears open for Lil Durk and his growing family.</p><h3><strong>How Did Lil Durk Become Famous?</strong></h3><p>As a rapper, Lil Durk has made a name for himself in the American music industry and is now a reckoning force. However, his journey to fame began in Englewood, a suburb neighborhood of the South Side of Chicago, infamously referred to as the murder capital.</p><p>The city, though infamous, has also produced other prominent figures in the music industry, including Jennifer Hudson, Lil Reese, Famous Dex, Mavis Staples, and Fredo Santana. Durk was born on the 19th of October 1992, and his birth name was Durk Banks.</p><p>From childhood, he was exposed to the realities of life in the crime-infested city. His father, Dontay Banks, Sr., was incarcerated when Durk was only 7. He was raised along with his siblings; 3 sisters and a brother named Dontay Banks Jr. (a.k.a D’thang), by their mother, who is a nurse.</p><p>Durk joined a gang, the Black Disciples alongside his brother, who was also a rapper. Unfortunately, Dontay Jr. was killed in a gang operation in 2011. His father, whom he referred to as Big Durk, was released from prison in February 2019 after 25 years.</p><p>When he was very young, Durk didn’t have the privilege of a father to provide for him. As a result, he found himself having to meet many family needs that are way bigger than him.</p><p>While it was a hard time for him, he admitted that it has helped him to weigh his every action and decision, especially since he started having kids of his own. Notably, Lil Durk had his first child at 18.</p><p>Although he had already spent some time behind bars for gun-related offenses, he said he doesn’t want his kids to go through what he went through. Hence, Lil Durk would avoid anything that will take him away from his little ones. He also wants his children to have all those moments he missed.</p><p>Following the birth of his child, Durk dropped out of school to support his young one. That was about the same period he began his music career in 2011. His music career kicked off with his affiliation with another Chicago rapper, Chief Keef’s label, formerly known as Glory Boyz Entertainment.</p><p>Though he has been around the scene for a while, Lil Durk’s career only started receiving public acclaim with the release of his hit singles, Sneak Dissing,&nbsp;and I’ ma Hitta,&nbsp;which went a long way to place him on the musical map.</p><p>Durk has also credited social media platforms like MySpace and YouTube with launching him into prominence. The rapid increase of his fan base encouraged him to do more.</p><p>He released a mixtape, Life ain’t no joke in 2012, and his follow-up single Dis Aint What You Want was rewarded with the joint venture deal with his record label OTF and Def Jam Recordings. His debut studio album, Remember My Name came in 2015, and it peaked at number 14 on the Billboard 200.</p><p>Lil Durk’s discography includes four studio albums, twelve mixtapes, two compilation albums, and twelve singles. With an estimated net worth of $3 million and a growing music career, Durk can confidently cater to the needs of his kids, while enjoying the moments with them as he continues to stay out of crime’s way.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunC4yKVkna2ioHqjtc5mmZqaqWK6ornAaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./are-georgia-and-dom-still-together.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Are Georgia and Dom Still Together?
