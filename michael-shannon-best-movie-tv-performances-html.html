Be it subverting their public perception as an avatar of cool (every time <a href=#>George Clooney</a> plays a bozo) or leaning into Herculean good looks for comedic effect (the thing Chris Hemsworth always tries so very hard to do and Ryan Gosling pulled off ten times as successfully in the <a href=#>Barbie trailer</a>), their performances work audiences with the deft hand of a stage magician or, perhaps more accurately, a professional wrestler.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clj77311w00233b6xplajn1k7@published data-word-count=96>This is all to say that Michael Shannon knows he looks like that. He knows he has the demeanor of a guy you’d go out of your way to not be stuck on a subway train with at 2 a.m. He knows he has resting Zodiac Killer face. He knows he’s six-foot-three. He knows he’s better at yelling than most of his peers. (<a href=#>Jon Bernthal</a> is perhaps his only real competition). What he’s done with this self-awareness over the past 40-plus years in Hollywood is create one of the more singular screen presences of his generation.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clj772xk2001b3b6x6hxplhci@published data-word-count=78>Shannon is unmistakable. He’s developed his screen persona with a workmanlike spirit, the same he brings to acting for the screen at large. A generous writer might say Shannon approaches screen acting with an immaculate professionalism. This one will be a bit more blunt and say that Shannon treats screen acting like his day job. He doesn’t hate it enough to quit but definitely seems vaguely annoyed by it most of the time, especially when <a href=#>promoting superhero movies</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clj773t7b000a3b6xqep5za8v@published data-word-count=142>To be clear: This rules. More actors should talk about showing up to set the same way I used to talk about having to work the opening shift of my college Starbucks. By his own admission he prefers performing onstage to acting in film and television, once <a href=#>explaining to Adam Driver in the Actors on Actors series</a> that the stage allows for continuous performance rather than one broken up by cuts and lunch breaks. He also seems to prefer ripping gigs with his indie band Corporal because of course Michael Shannon is in a band. There’s nobody quite like him, and he knows there’s nobody quite like him. He’s one of our best. With his <a href=#>directorial debut premiering at Tribeca</a> and his return to the DCEU in The Flash, let’s give him his due with a tour of his essential onscreen performances.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clj776y29001j3b6xzi2yi6fd@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Groundhog Day (1993)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clj774f9t000f3b6x7dnf3o11@published data-word-count=109>Did you know Michael Shannon is in Groundhog Day? Michael Shannon is in Groundhog Day. Weird! He made his big-screen debut with a bit part in the film as Fred, one half of a newlywed couple whom Bill Murray’s Phil surprises with tickets to Wrestlemania. Again, weird! If you’ve never recognized him in the role when watching or rewatching (on loop during a day that repeats itself over and over) the Harold Ramis classic, it’s probably because Michael Shannon looks all of 20 years old in this movie and he’s one of those actors who’s hard to imagine looking younger than like, 47.

He spent years honing that persona in underrated flicks like John Waters’s Cecil B. Demented and Joel Schumacher’s Tigerland before turning in a wicked performance as Greg, the abusive boyfriend of Eminem’s mom. Shannon’s take on Greg is, “What if there was a guy who was a world-title contender for Worst Dude?,” and he succeeds in full. In a career that serves as a study in the nuanced ways in which a person can be awful, Greg is sort of ground zero — transparently, relentlessly awful to everyone around him in an entirely uncomplicated way.</p>Streaming on Tubi <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Watch here</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clj77d0mg002b3b6xzh4u70ir@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Kangaroo Jack (2003)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clj774f9w000j3b6x7dlwjil3@published data-word-count=88>Remember that time there was a movie about Jerry O’Connell and Anthony Anderson chasing a kangaroo through the Australian outback because it steals a hoodie with $50,000 of mob money in it, all while said mob chases them, and the trailer seemed to imply that the kangaroo would talk?

It’s a nasty thriller with a top-tier creative team behind it, which follows a woman named Agnes who becomes involved with an ex-soldier (Shannon) with a mysterious past. It had all the makings of a slow-burn hit, the sort of low-budget horror/horror-adjacent flick that can easily make all its money back in a single weekend if positioned correctly. So of course Lionsgate opened it against a movie called Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End, which raked in well over $100 million on that opening weekend. It isn’t fair to say Bug was forgotten when it never even got the chance to be remembered by the moviegoing public in the first place. Still, it’s never too late to make up for lost time. Bug is the sort of movie you’d watch once a year were it not for how hard it is to watch a second time.</p>Streaming on PlutoTV <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Watch here</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clj77i7bi003b3b6xwqx84mgl@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Revolutionary Road (2008)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clj774fa7000o3b6xd4jgq3gf@published data-word-count=64>Sam Mendes’s 2008 drama is a two-hander starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, one of the more iconic onscreen duos of the last 40 years.

The show features a sprawling ensemble headed up by Steve Buscemi’s gangster Nucky Thompson, a politician–slash–mob boss in 1920s New Jersey. Shannon plays Nelson Van Alden, a Bureau of Prohibition agent with a puritanical streak and, true to what was becoming recognizable at the time as the Shannon form, a rubber-band ball of repression any therapist would have a field day with. The shape of the show’s ensemble ebbed and flowed over the course of its five seasons, but Shannon remained a reliable figurehead of it throughout the run. It stands today as some of his best work.</p>Streaming on Max <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Watch here</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clj77o5gb00473b6x4ehsqjab@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Take Shelter (2011)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clj774faa000s3b6xzsfxutzi@published data-word-count=65>Take Shelter isn’t the first collaboration between Shannon and director Jeff Nichols (they first joined for 2007’s microbudget Shotgun Stories) but it served as a main-stage debut of sorts for the pair. Nichols’s film stars Shannon as a man in rural Ohio who begins having dreams of an apocalyptic storm. Believing them to be premonitions, he erratically prepares his family for the horrors to come.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clj77qg0g004h3b6x319mea8z@published data-word-count=74>Take Shelter is a weapon. Shannon has turned in countless great performances guided by world-class directors in the years since its release. Still, to date, it feels like the greatest synthesis of his skills and the vision of a director who knows how to use them, a film structured around the specific energy of its lead performer.

Shannon faces off against him as a corrupt NYPD cop. Sony dumped the film into theaters in late August, and it quickly came and went with little fanfare.

His commitment to playing stiffs, bullies, and psychos seemed to lack a certain self-awareness. Was this guy acting? Was he actually just an all-time bad hang? The answer is and has always been no. Michael Shannon is a great actor precisely because of his immense self-awareness, and his recitation of the infamous Delta Gamma sorority letter is perhaps the single greatest testament to this.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clj7808b600643b6xhbegu6nu@published data-word-count=86>In 2013, a letter from the president of a chapter of the Delta Gamma sorority to the rest of her sisters went viral for its aggressive profanity and threats of violence. It’s incredible comedy on its own, but when Funny or Die had Shannon recite it in its entirety, it became art. Shannon delivers the recitation totally straight, simmering with his trademark barely contained rage and letting it explode on only the choicest of lines, including “Newsflash, ya stupid fucking cocks! Frats don’t like boring sororities!”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clj780gsr00693b6xo0yguhan@published data-word-count=40>It may seem silly to call this one of the highlights of such a rich filmography, but it just is.

Clearly pegged as an awards-season contender, it garnered little outside of Supporting Actor nods at the Golden Globes and SAG Awards for Shannon, who co-stars as a seedy real-estate mogul opposite Andrew Garfield as his reluctant apprentice.

Much of Shannon’s best work happens in films that fail to make back their budget at the box office, and Midnight Special is no different.
