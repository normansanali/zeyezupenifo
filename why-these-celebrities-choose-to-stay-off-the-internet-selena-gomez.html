Many celebrities have taken some time away from social media. Whether it was for health reasons, personal reasons or they were just too busy enjoying their real life. We don't blame them, it can be difficult being in the public eye and giving the fans unprecedented access to their private life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Social media can be a double-edged sword to those in the spotlight, leaving singers, models, reality stars and actors open to being bullied, harassed and abused.</p><p>Whether they took a break from posting, wiped their entire social media accounts, or have ditched it forever, these stars have made headlines for deleting social media. Here are the stars who have spoken out about the darkness that lurks behind having an Instagram, Twitter or Facebook account and why they have chosen to quit social media entirely.</p><h2 id=selena-gomez><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Selena Gomez</span></h2><p>Despite being one of the most-followed people on Instagram, <strong><a href=#>Selena Gomez </a></strong>left the social platform back in 2018. <a href=#>She revealed that her decision to quit social media, ultimately "saved" her life.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although she initially wanted to delete her social profiles entirely, her team convinced her not to and offered to post on behalf of her. Although her social media accounts are active, someone posts for her, so she can stay away from the platforms.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Selena Gomez's Favorite Foods (According To Social Media)">Selena Gomez's Favorite Foods (According To Social Media)</a></span></p><p>"I'm happy I didn't, because it is such a wonderful way to stay connected, and when I do go on, it makes me happy to know that I'm just being completely honest and being true to who I am," she revealed. "I say that because that's a huge, significant part of why I feel like I've been as healthy as I have been [...] I'm completely unaware of actually what's going on in pop culture, and that makes me really happy. And maybe that doesn't make everybody else happy, but for me, it's really saved my life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=keira-knightley><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Keira Knightley</span></h2><p>Keira Knightley doesn't have a social media presence, but that is not for lack of trying. She revealed on a British talk show that she has a Twitter account but took it down after 12 hours. "I tried to be down with the kids and it just creeped me out," she said.</p><p>"I didn't post anything, and I was under a false name and I think because Chloë [Grace Moretz] followed me, suddenly all these people started following me and posting, 'I'm having a cup of tea now,' and I just got completely freaked out."</p><h2 id=sandra-bullock><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Sandra Bullock</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sandra Bullock is notoriously private, which means she doesn't have time for social media. Fifty-seven-year-old Bullock says that the main reason behind her frustration at social media is that the images are unrealistic.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"We're not representing our lives truthfully," </a>Bullock told U.K.'s The Times. "Like when you're yelling at your child, you're not taking a selfie of you being a horrible parent."</p><p>"No, you're waiting for the perfect selfie," she continued. "'Do I look thinner now?' 'Do I look great?' It's this false projection of one's life. Hollywood has now gone global.

I just would be like, ‘What does everyone else think?’” she said on the chat show. Although her account became active to urge Americans to vote and to promote her recent album, she does not update it with personal content.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=meghan-markle><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Meghan Markle</span></h2><p>Following her engagement to Prince Harry, <strong><a href=#>Meghan Markle</a></strong> closed all of her social media accounts.
