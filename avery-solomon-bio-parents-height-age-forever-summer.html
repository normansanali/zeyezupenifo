Keep reading this Avery Solomon Bio to find out.</span></p><h3><b>Avery Solomon On Forever Summer: Hamptons</b></h3><p><span>Amazon Prime’s </span><i><span>Forever Summer: Hamptons</span></i><span> premiered on July 15, 2022, and just like any other steamy summer series, the show followed a group of 12 college students spending their summer break in the Hamptons. However, not every cast member was a Hampton native, a few outsiders also joined the crew for “fun, surf, and good vibes.”</span></p><p><span>Some even say this series was a mix of </span><i><span>Blue Lagoon</span></i><span> + </span><i><span>Siesta Key</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Now, coming to Avery’s time on </span><i><span>Forever Summer</span></i><span>, she went to be close friends <a href=#>Reid Rubio</a>. The two never hesitated to share anything and everything with each other. However, Reid was a people pleaser. He would often go behind people’s backs to please others, with one time even going as far as to speak ill of Avery behind her back.</span></p><p><span>Naturally, Avery was then tired of Reid’s behavior and how changed his tune according to the people he interacted with.

But I think right now I’m just living life in my 20s and having fun doing whatever I can,” she told </span><i><span>Women’s Health</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also, Avery seems to have forgiven Reid.
