Although her late father was famous TV producer Aaron Spelling, Tori has worked hard her entire adult life, whether getting acting jobs or <a href=#>starring in many reality series</a>. Unfortunately, even though she has been a familiar face in Hollywood, she doesn't have a high net worth. In fact, since she first became famous, her net worth has gone down significantly.</p><p>Fans have known about Tori Spelling's difficult financial situation for a while, and a few lawsuits only complicated matters. Here's the truth about the lawsuits that the star dealt with.</p><h2 id=tori-spelling-was-sued-over-credit-card-debt>Tori Spelling Was Sued Over Credit Card Debt</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Express sued Tori Spelling in January 2016</a>, according to CBS News. The last time that the actress paid off her credit card was in June 2015 for $1,040. However, Spelling didn't have enough money in her account to pay that amount.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/are-tori-spelling-and-dean-mcdermott-on-speaking-terms-after-their-tumultuous-break-up-after-17-years-together_.jpg><p>CBS News reported that a court document stated that <strong>Spelling owed $38,836.97</strong> which included court fees of $855 and $37,981.97. While this 2016 lawsuit would have taken a big chunk out of Spelling's net worth, the lawsuit wasn't resolved quickly, and things intensified over the next few years. According to Us Weekly, <strong>Spelling owed $88,246.55 in 2019</strong>.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tori Spelling's net worth is $150,000</a>, according to Celebrity Net Worth, and her money issues have continued for a long time now. While her acting career started strong with her beloved role on Beverly Hills, 90210, Spelling has since struggled to maintain a high net worth. When Spelling's father Aaron Spelling passed away, fans assumed that his daughter would receive a ton of money. Unfortunately for the actress and reality TV personality, although <a href=#>Aaron Spelling had a net worth of $600 million</a>, he <a href=#>gave Tori $800,000 after his death</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar52011568-1.jpg><p>Spelling has worked steadily and has hosted several reality shows such as 2022's Love At First Lie and has also written several memoirs.

When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spelling was interviewed about the reboot BH90210</a> in 2019 by Fox 5's Good Day New York, she was asked "Are you able to pay your bills?"

Spelling said, "That was a choice that I made and we made together to put that in there. That's such speculation and the media loves to talk about it.
