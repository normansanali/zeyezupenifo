Canada</strong></p><p id=edGeu6Vw7i5 data-wc=50>Slipping out onto the expansive deck of her Blue Mountain home with its endless, idyllic landscape, Dateline correspondent <strong>Andrea Canning</strong> is the picture of serenity – for about 60 seconds, until our conversation is punctuated by one curious child after another squeezing through the screen doors in search of Mommy.</p><p id=eBrDaWA0w0k data-wc=84>No interruption fazes the Canadian-born 46-year-old mother of six, who remains unruffled despite the fact that she hasn’t had a chance to fix her hair and makeup (she does it herself) or even change her clothes ahead of our imminent photo shoot. Not to worry, though – we can tell Andrea is one of those people who rolls out of bed looking effortlessly camera-ready, just like the characters in her favourite 1990s show, Melrose Place (these days, she has <strong>Heather Locklear</strong> on speed dial).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4d90486cc93c-body53-z.jpg><p class=caption id=ezN2VP73ftEE data-wc=6>Photo: © Constant Van Ruymbeke/HELLO! Canada</p><p id=eJHRhkgJBcxu data-wc=31>As she gently shoos a child away yet again – “No, we can’t play music outside!” – we discuss the challenges of keeping a half-dozen kids occupied at any given time.</p><p id=e6Eifs-VRVh- data-wc=11>“I’ve lost count of how many iPads I have!” Andrea jokes.</p><p id=eRW1kQki9-vA data-wc=81>Or maybe she’s not joking. She and her husband of 11 years, Lt.-Col. <strong>George Anthony “Tony” Bancroft</strong> of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, are parents to <strong>Anna</strong>, 10, <strong>Charlie</strong>, 9, <strong>Kiki</strong>, 7, <strong>Georgia</strong>, 5, <strong>Elle</strong>, 4, and three-month-old <strong>George, Jr. </strong>– a.k.a. <strong>Tripp</strong> (their only son, conceived via IVF). And although they’re model children, they’re also, well, kids. Shortly before our photo shoot, in fact, tiny Elle took scissors to her own hair! Andrea and Tony take it all in stride.</p><p id=exY-nVPZh4jS data-wc=21>“It’s a lot of work, but we don’t care. We love it,” she says. “Our motto is, ‘Just roll with it.’”</p><h2>FROM BLUE MOUNTAIN TO BAYWATCH</h2><p id=eHO2tP3xUGY9 data-wc=54>Perhaps it’s her upbringing in the peaceful atmosphere of Ontario’s Blue Mountain that has infused Andrea with her laid-back attitude. She and Tony – who live in Westchester County, N.Y. – couldn’t be more welcoming as we arrive to photograph the whole family at her Canadian childhood home on a breezy late summer’s day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/04eba1293039-body53-z.jpg><p class=caption id=eZh4n4sxe7LK data-wc=21>The girls, who attend public school in Westchester, N.Y., love their second home in Canada. Photo: © Constant Van Ruymbeke/HELLO! Canada</p><p id=e6-qooKHuEvO data-wc=53>The six-bedroom Scandinavian-style house, owned by her father, <strong>Gordon</strong>, is where Andrea was born and raised – close to the picturesque ski and golf resort that was, incredibly, founded by her maternal grandparents, <strong>Jozo and <strong>Helen Weider</strong>. Her mother, <strong>Katherine</strong> </strong>(who heartbreakingly passed away of cancer in 2007), was a downhill ski champion.</p><p id=eJ9_qkisPAoa data-wc=9>“She was an incredible racer,” her daughter says wistfully.</p><p id=eWzXQ7FBXwE1 data-wc=20>Continuing on her mom’s competitive spirit, little Andrea grew up “skiing, playing tennis, boating, mountain biking – you name it.”</p><p id=eWd7_5wYUXUv data-wc=70>Her athletic pursuits took a back seat as her vocational endeavours took over. Always interested in what makes people tick, Andrea graduated in psychology from the University of Western Ontario, then studied radio and television arts at Toronto-based Ryerson University before taking herself off to Hollywood for an internship at Baywatch - a gig that saw her become a professional assistant and nanny for <span><strong>David Hasselhoff</strong></span><span></span> and his first wife.</p><p id=evZVQudFjiaY data-wc=9>“He’s extremely generous and very, very funny,” she says.</p><p id=e3JPAdB1K3UJ data-wc=5>She also roomed with <a class=hm-link href=#>Ryan Seacrest</a>!</p><p id=eE_lpRRkVKlB data-wc=53>Working her way up the career ladder, Andrea landed stints at ABC News, Good Morning America and the Today show. Her surprise break, though, came in 2011 with a 20/20 <a class=hm-link href=#>Charlie Sheen</a> interview that saw her tackle the controversial Hollywood star on issues ranging from drug use to his rift with his famous father, <a class=hm-link href=#>Martin Sheen</a>.</p><p id=eYorttSQCfEE data-wc=7>“It was my biggest ever,” she says.</p><p id=el4e5X6_UUUK data-wc=9>The video went viral and Dateline called shortly thereafter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ee91263aad9b-body53-z.jpg><p class=caption id=eejGyAkiS_-K data-wc=6>Photo: © Constant Van Ruymbeke/HELLO! Canada</p><p id=eyz0qk25DKd3 data-wc=70>Amid the dream gigs and a life of perpetual travel, Andrea also managed to meet the man of her dreams, U.S. fighter pilot Tony, 44, through her foreign-affairs correspondent friend <strong>Martha Raddatz</strong>, whom he met while stationed in Iraq. The couple started out as pen pals. Tying the knot two years later in 2008, they quickly had baby Anna, now 10, whom they introduced in the pages of Hello! Canada.</p><p id=ekBDC8lRE0FA data-wc=27>“We didn’t know what we were doing!” says a smiling Tony (who now works as a financial advisor for investment mogul <strong>Mario Gabelli</strong>), reflecting on first-time parenthood.</p><p id=e4dCyns12buF data-wc=23>“Just clueless!” chimes in Andrea. “There were some easier years in the middle and now with six, it’s like we’re back to chaos.”</p><p id=eTc8IoWGuTk6 data-wc=13>“We wanted to plan a babymoon,” adds Tony, joking: “But she got pregnant!”</p><p id=eSTQ_i8XVLou data-wc=26>Andrea chatted with <strong>HELLO! Canada</strong> about everything from what it’s like raising six kids to her thoughts on <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Harry</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Duchess Meghan</a> and what she misses most about Canada.</p><p id=eMitisMHLb8w data-wc=32><strong>HELLO! Canada: Andrea, when we last caught up with you, you just had one child. Now you have six! As an only child yourself, did you ever envision such a large family?</strong></p><p id=eGvSSlJJDGQ5 data-wc=64>Absolutely not. [In fact] I was fearful that I wouldn’t be able to have even one. Tony was in the military when we got married and I was like “I’m getting older and you’re in the military.” I was freaking out a little bit because we weren’t even living in the same city at first. But lo and behold, we had a honeymoon baby!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/94a9c9f3b424-body53-z.jpg><p class=caption id=eGD0BtQ73RFw data-wc=28>"We have built-in baby sitters," Andrea jokes of her five little helpers. "They get diapers, they feed him. They love holding him." Photo: © Constant Van Ruymbeke/HELLO! Canada</p><p id=eEE1zMDWqTpF data-wc=7><strong>And pretty soon you had five girls.</strong></p><p id=eYUyAa59sMwU data-wc=21>It was amazing. [After Elle’s birth] I was like, “Wow, we were able to have a fifth. Who would have thought?”</p><p id=emjdII1q7nJp data-wc=6><strong>But then you wanted a boy…</strong></p><p id=e-YW9Q2JiuY1 data-wc=73>That’s when we did IVF, yeah. Just to be clear, though, we didn’t do IVF specifically to have a boy. We knew we just wanted to have one more and if it was a boy, wonderful, and if it was a girl, we were still going to have another one. We did the genetic testing for health reasons and the boy was the higher-quality embryo. So we had one chance, and it worked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/589cf4fa4c86-body53-z.jpg><p class=caption id=ewby0ySu-H2H data-wc=56>Andrea says heroic Tony is the one who gets out of bed for Tripp’s nightly feeds. While the couple would have been just as thrilled with a sixth girl, she says having a baby boy was ‘meant to be’ – the male embryo was more viable for transfer during IVF. Photo: © Constant Van Ruymbeke/HELLO! Canada</p><p id=egcatW-at1k2 data-wc=8><strong>Was the IVF really tough on you physically?</strong></p><p id=eQGofu-kvhSt data-wc=66>At times it was. And especially trying to juggle my job, travelling and not telling anybody at work what I was doing. Everyone [at work] just expects you to be free and get on a plane. “We have to do this now!” And I’m like, “I can’t.” And it’s like, “Well, why not?” So that got stressful, just kind of dancing around what I was doing.</p><p id=e5mFJDxSzKg- data-wc=6><strong>So you and yourfriends watched it?</strong></p><p id=ecfi0sxseYEu data-wc=61>Yes, we all watched it! And I remember meeting him rightafter. It was Thanksgiving. I met him at the hotel he was staying at in Maryland.I walked in and he had on his pilot jacket and he was standing at the fireplacewith his back to me. And he turned around and I swear it was out of Top Gun or something.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/da8b1d58190e-body35-z.jpg><p class=caption id=ezSpzmfHR3jT data-wc=6>Photo: © Constant Van Ruymbeke/HELLO!

Andthen we went to Denny’s and talked until like six in the morning. And that wasit.</p><p id=e8gLKNMRX4WM data-wc=17><strong>Were you surprisedthat you had such a connection with a military man? Did you know any beforeTony?</strong></p><p id=e5p5GOmBt6Kq data-wc=52>Well, both my grandfather and great-grandfather had mettheir brides through the war. And I had met military men before through work. Butnot anybody that I knew really well. I wasn’t surprised – I guess I just neverreally thought about it. And then you’re just in it, and you’re like, “OK, thisis working.”</p><p id=e4HwdPPvLUzp data-wc=3><strong>What’s Tony’s bestquality?</strong></p><p id=etDI6dHTqrWv data-wc=13>Kindness. You can ask anybody. He’s one of the nicest peopleyou’ll ever meet.</p><p id=e8_gnoSyQap8 data-wc=4><strong>He’s a real peopleperson.</strong></p><p id=eHH0If9WAkjn data-wc=28>He really is. I always say to people, “If you have a problemwith Tony, there’s something wrong with you.” Because why would you ever have aproblem with him?</p><p id=eKIGsLnDgE-w data-wc=3><strong>He seems veryempathetic</strong>.</p><p id=euB0lETXZgDb data-wc=17>Very much. And he literally would give you the shirt off hisback. He’s that kind of person.</p><p id=eHo5z8c32-ig data-wc=20><strong>It must have been an adjustmentfor him becoming a civilian after, what was it, 16 years in with the military?</strong></p><p id=ewOOYFxyZMTO data-wc=30>Oh yeah, he had to move into a tiny Upper West Sideapartment with a baby and a wife – after living a block from the beach as thebachelor fighter pilot!</p><p id=eATlRgiBLUAh data-wc=8><strong>You had along-distance relationship at first, didn’t you?</strong></p><p id=eMscPH0ISxrG data-wc=57>We did. Even when we were married. We were apart for thefirst year and a bit. So yeah. I think that was a bit of an adjustment for him.He got over it… When our fourth baby was on the way, we moved to Rye, inWestchester County, N.Y. And it’s just the most perfect place to raise afamily.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/89faad570cc6-body53-z.jpg><p id=eizNK6Cq0jRm data-wc=9><strong>How much time did youtake off with each baby?</strong></p><p id=erLkb9zRsauf data-wc=33>Not long. The first one was two months and then it was like sixweeks after that. That’s all they give you [in the U.S.] Now, this time I’mtaking four months. They’ve upped it.</p><p id=e6cL9xfhCLZR data-wc=9><strong>Wow. Because in Canadanow, you can take 18 months!</strong></p><p id=eSb-O4sXV5BZ data-wc=7>I would not mind that at all.</p><p id=eSPc0bVqioSI data-wc=14><strong>How do the girls feelabout your job, now that they’re old enough to understand?</strong></p><p id=egkUfF90DOzA data-wc=94>Well, this is the life they know. From the first one to thelast one, they all know that Mom travels and works. I asked them the other day,because they said something about, “Do you have to go back to work?” And I waslike, “Well, if I don’t go back to work, that means I would have to quit myjob. Do you want me to quit my job?” “No, you have a cool job.” Well, all butone [said that]. The five-year-old said, “Yes, please quit your job, Mom.” Butthe other ones were all like, “No!”</p><p id=e-TrHA5_w4lV data-wc=5><strong>Do they watch you onTV?</strong></p><p id=eARnv4blk7WI data-wc=19>They do… And they used to be on GMA all the time, whenever there were segments that needed kids.</p><p id=eDqon51fnYmw data-wc=4><strong>What’s your proudestmoment professionally?</strong></p><p id=e-rJdG3gs4U3 data-wc=37>Making it to a national newsmagazine in New York City on oneof the big three networks… I’m also proud of landing the Charlie Sheeninterview [after he was fired from Two AndA Half Men].

Inside I was like, “What is happening?”</p><p id=e0GjtM3TmAHT data-wc=4><strong>How did it comeabout?</strong></p><p id=epQa5EJQwX6t data-wc=156>I aired a story about Charlie on Good Morning America. The sound bite ended with Charlie on theradio saying, “Why doesn’t anybody get me?” I looked over at [co-anchor] <strong>George Stephanopoulos</strong> and I said, “Yeah,why doesn’t anybody get him?” Like, sarcastically. I was laughing. And Iremember thinking to myself, “If only I had his cell number, I bet I couldconvince him to do the interview.” But I forgot about it. I don’t have his cellnumber. So I go back to my office, my phone rings, and it’s Charlie’spublicist. And he says, “Would you be able to talk to Charlie?” So Charliecalled me and he said, “You know what? You’re the first person to laugh in agood way about me. I can tell you didn’t take me too seriously. Let’s keeptalking.” He just happened to catch the segment. Ten days later, I did theinterview. And I look back on it like, “Oh my gosh, what just happened?”</p><p id=eD75tRGll9fM data-wc=5><strong>Who would be yourdream interview?</strong></p><p id=eu7pN6oPhlBo data-wc=20><a class=hm-link href=#>Tom Cruise</a>, if he would spill the beans on everything abouthis religion and personal life.

I was just thinking about it this morning.Mostly I feel bad for Meghan, because everybody loved her before the wedding,and everyone was so excited about the wedding. But now, it’s like people arepicking apart everything she does. I don’t envy her – I mean, yes, it’s greatto be a princess, but also you’re really under the white-hot spotlight, andthat’s tough. People are comparing her with Diana. With Kate, [she and William]just quietly started this relationship in college. It’s much different thanHarry suddenly dating an American actress.</p><p id=eos4pRAH4tVXn data-wc=14><strong>What would you askHarry and Meghan if you had them in the hot seat?</strong></p><p id=ekgKV0qRlE2b5 data-wc=44>“Is there anything about this you regret? What would you dodifferently?” I’m sure she has no regrets. They seem really in love. She gother baby. They seem like a good match. I don’t know. There’s no princesshandbook, unfortunately. “Here, don’t do this.
