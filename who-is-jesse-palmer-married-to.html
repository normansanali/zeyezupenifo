Palmer attended the University of Florida for football, then played in the <a href=# rel=noopener>NFL</a> for the New York Giants and San Francisco 49ers. Are you also interested in knowing who Jesse Palmer is married to? Who, then, is Jesse Palmer’s spouse? Read this to find out everything there is to know about the TV host’s girlfriend.</p><h2>Who Is Jesse Palmer?</h2><p>In 2006, Jesse Palmer spent part of the season playing for the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Palmer played the role of the Bachelor on the fifth season of the reality TV series<a href=# rel=noopener> The Bachelor</a> in 2004. Since then, he’s worked as a college football analyst for ESPN/ABC in the United States and as a columnist for The Sports Network’s Canadian website.</p><p>Aside from that, he also gives his opinion on GMA on ABC. He presided over the premiere of ABC’s The Proposal in 2018. He has been the host of Food Network’s Holiday Baking Championship since 2017. From 2017 through 2020, Jesse presided. On June 5, 2020, Palmer wed model Emely Fardo at the home of a mutual acquaintance in Connecticut. When Palmer was announced as the next host of “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette” in 2021, she took over the role permanently in 2022.</p><h2>Who Is Emely Fardo?</h2><p>Even though Fardo was born in Brazil, she began her professional life in New York. Her 2016 Instagram post touting her new New York Model Management comp cards is the only evidence we have that she was a model at any point.</p><p>Even though Fardo is most comfortable in front of the lens, she has also done professional photography work. The Brazilian model has posted several high-quality photos of herself to Instagram in the past. Some of Fardo’s culinary photography from <a href=# rel=noopener>New York</a> City restaurants, such as drinks and sugary pancakes, was shared in 2016 and 2017. She also showed off a wedding picture she took of a couple who had just tied the knot.</p><h2>Who Is Jesse Palmer Married To?</h2><p>While Jesse Palmer’s season 5 candidates on The Bachelorette didn’t end up with him, he did find love with model Emely Fardo.</p><p>Soon after ABC announced Palmer would take over as host of the iconic show in September 2021, reports confirmed that the former Bachelor’s leading man was married. When Palmer was cast as the fifth Bachelor in 2004, he was a returning cast member. He was dating Jessica Bowlin at the end of the season, but they called it quits a few weeks later.</p><p>Palmer and Fardo started dating in 2017 and recently engaged in Paris this past July. After they were engaged, he told the<a href=# rel=noopener> Daily Mail</a>, “I’ve been so enamored, so in love with this woman, and it only has grown. I’m head over heels for her.” Wedding plans were put on hold in the wake of the epidemic, but the happy couple finally spoke their vows in a small ceremony in 2020.</p><p>The couple is not bashful about posting pictures of their relationship online. They keep their Instagram followers updated with views of their daily lives and travels worldwide (their cute Aussie Doodle, LouLou, also makes regular appearances).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Jesse-and-Fardo.jpg><h2>Where Did Jesse and Fardo Meet?</h2><p>Palmer and Fardo both have careers in the entertainment industry, but they met outside of work in a boxing class.</p><p>The former NFL quarterback recently told the Daily Mail that he and his now-fiancee, Fardo, met at a boxing class and felt a “spark” with her immediately. He said, “She has taught me, cares for me like no one else.”</p><h2>Jesse and Fardo’s Secret Wedding</h2><p>Even though Fardo and Palmer have been very open about their romance online, they have kept their wedding a secret. They weren’t even spotted wearing wedding bands until the summer of 2021, long after their followers had forgotten all about their marriages.</p><p>After having to postpone their wedding in Provence, France, the couple finally tied the knot in a small, intimate ceremony on June 5, 2020, at the home of a close friend in Connecticut. “We were only able to invite a select group of close friends that live in the greater N.Y.C. region and that was in quarantine at the time,” they said. We had a wonderful day, and we can’t wait till our entire families can join us in celebrating our love.</p><p>The couple was delighted with their wedding, even though it was far more low-key than they had initially planned. Whether our wedding is vast or small, they said we are happy to have discovered each other. She enjoys exercise, especially when she can do it with Palmer by her side.</p><p>It’s no surprise that Fardo is so into working out, given that that’s how he and his wife originally got together. The model frequently uploads pictures of her workouts, typically with Palmer as her training partner.</p><p>She published images of herself and Loulou engaging in Pilates and running together. After meeting, Fardo and Palmer have continued to train together, even sharing in 2020 that Fardo had finished 12 Rumble boxing lessons in three weeks, with Palmer joining her for the final two.</p><p>Keep following <a href=# rel=noopener>venturejolt.com</a> for more updates.
