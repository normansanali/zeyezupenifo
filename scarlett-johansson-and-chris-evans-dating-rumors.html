That was the case for <strong><a href=#>Scarlett Johansson</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Chris Evans</a></strong>, whose friendship goes all the way back to the year of 2004. Johansson and Evans have, so far, starred in nine movies together, and there's a high chance there are more to come.</p><p>Due to Johansson's and Evans's excellent chemistry, both on and off-screen, the fans and the public have always believed there was something more to their friendship. A great number of fans have been hoping the two would eventually end up together. Despite no such rumor ever getting officially confirmed, even the producers and executives have always been wary about the duo's close relationship. Early on in their co-star relationship, Johansson and Evans were apparently warned not to date each other.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Chris Evans' Comic Con Appearance Took A Turn Putting A Focus On His Wedding Ring</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=johansson-and-evans-were-prohibited-from-dating-each-other>Johansson And Evans Were Prohibited From Dating Each Other</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/your-paragraph-text-2023-11-23t070033-022.png><p>For those who weren't aware, Scarlett and Chris first met on the set of a film called The Perfect Score. Johansson was only twenty at the time, while Evans had just turned twenty-three. The movie follows a high-schooler, Kyle (Evans), who needs to receive a perfect SAT score.</p><p>To reach that level, he forms a group of people to help him achieve it. Although the pair didn't share a lot of scenes together, they instantly became friends.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Evans recalled he was shocked to learn that Johansson was younger than him</a>:</p><p>"Not because of how she looked but because of how she had this poise, this wisdom. Everyone always says Scarlett is wise beyond her years."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, any time celebrities develop a friendship, there are always fans who ship them together. It turns out that those around Scarlett and Chris also realized the two would likely have chemistry.</p><p>A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube short mentioning Johansson's and Evans' dating rumors</a> has recently resurfaced on social media. The clip reveals an interesting detail about the two, shared by Perfect Score's director Brian Robbins in an interview back in the day. Robbins apparently warned them about dating each other:</p><p>"They hang out together a lot. But I told them in the first day of rehearsal [of the Perfect Score], that they can't sleep with each other. And, I'm not quite sure whether they obey[ed] me 'cause there was a lot of skinny-dipping going on. So, I'm not saying anything happened, but ... who knows."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Scarlett Johansson Didn't Have A Prenup With Ryan Reynolds, But She Still Held Her Own During The Divorce Settlement</a></span></p><h2 id=scarlett-and-chris-have-always-been-followed-by-dating-rumors>Scarlett and Chris Have Always Been Followed By Dating Rumors</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/scarlett-johansson-and-chris-evans-premiere.jpg><p>Having a close relationship with someone in Hollywood means one thing, and one thing only. Dating rumors among celebrities is what keeps the media thriving. The same fate has followed Johansson and Evans, whose strong bond goes back over twenty years.</p><p>In fact, <a href=#>ScarlJo was the one who convinced Evans to join the MCU</a> and become the legendary Captain America.</p><p><strong>Despite the media and fan speculation about the true nature of their close relationship, the two actors have reportedly never been involved with each other romantically.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johansson has always referred to her relationship with Evans as sibling-like</a>: "We could talk for hours, and about all kinds of stuff, in a way the sort of like big sister relationship that Nat has sometimes with Steve — even though Chris is a couple of years older than me — but I think we sort of have that same dynamic."</p><p>The duo have shared an on-screen kiss numerous times, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johansson has never thought of kissing Evans as a big deal</a>:</p><p>"Any excuse to get close to Chris Evans is delightful ... At this point, we're old and jaded, so it's like, 'Bring him on!' No big deal. Pop in the Tic-Tacs. Get the cameras rolling."</p><p><a href=#>Fans are always delighted to see Johansson and Evans play in the same movie</a>, and the Twitter reactions, after their reunion in a new movie Ghosted was announced, are the proof. All the fans need is to see the pair's names and romantic comedy in a sentence together, and they all lose their minds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Is Chris Evans Taking A Social Media Break After The Rumored Engagement With Alba Baptista?</a></span></p><h2 id=johansson-and-evans-are-both-married-to-their-respective-spouses>Johansson And Evans Are Both Married To Their Respective Spouses</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar51797477-1.jpg><p>It's more than likely that the audience's wishes, to see the pair get together, are never going to be granted. Both Evans and Johansson have already found their life partners in somebody else.</p><p>Although <a href=#>Johansson and Colin Jost keep their relationship private</a>, they have been married and going strong since 2020. Instead of publicly bragging about their wedding, the married couple had decided to commemorate the big day differently: Jost opened up about their wedding:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Scarlett wanted to figure out a way of doing something that had another kind of meaning or could potentially help in some way. We talked about places that we would love to help, and Meals on Wheels was at the top of our list, just getting very basic food to people that need it seems like the most basic way to help."</p><p>Chris <a href=#>Evans has also been very private about his relationship with Alba Baptista</a>, whom he has recently married. The Portuguese actress and the American sweetheart apparently enjoyed not one, but two wedding ceremonies to commemorate their marriage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqnJmiobK1wIyjpqGZnqjAsLqMmqWdZZOdv6q%2FjJ6tmqajYrGiwMinnmaqpaK8s7%2BO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./diddy-saw-women-as-things-after-ex-girlfriend-death-traumatizing.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sources Say Diddy Saw Women As 'Things' After Ex-Girlfriend's Death Traumatized Him">&larr;
