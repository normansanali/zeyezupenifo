Numerous fans have taken to social media platforms to seek details regarding his cause of death, obituary, and funeral arrangements. Stay tuned as we delve into these matters and more.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-kenny-deforest><strong>Who is Kenny DeForest?</strong></h2><p>DeForest is a popular stand-up comedian who has often been hailed as ‘one of the funniest and most beloved comics any of us knew.’</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kenny-deforest-cause-of-death-how-did-he-die><strong>Kenny DeForest cause of death: How did he die?</strong></h2><p>DeForest passed away on Wednesday, December 13th, due to injuries sustained on December 8th in Brooklyn, New York. The confirmation of his demise was made on a GoFundMe page created by his friends to gather funds for his family’s medical expenses.</p><p>Ryan Beck, a fellow comedian, revealed that DeForest had undergone surgery to alleviate pressure from a brain bleed by removing a portion of his skull.</p><p>Initially, those closest to DeForest believed that he had been struck by a car. However, an Emergency Medical Services (EMS) report suggests that he was riding an e-bike at the time of the accident.</p><p>Beck told&nbsp;Deadline: “We’ve learnt more information today from an EMS report. Kenny was on an e-bike and crashed. I spoke with crossing guards at the area today, and am still in search of more information. There is no police report because it was not a hit-and-run as first understood.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kenny-deforest-obituary-tributes-pour-in-for-late-entertainer><strong>Kenny DeForest obituary: Tributes pour in for late entertainer</strong></h2><p>Announcing the news of DeForest’s death, Beck added he died “surrounded by his parents, family, and friends”.</p><p>“Kenny’s final moments included some of his favorite songs, stories of his childhood, and memories of his extensive positivity and joy for life,” he wrote.</p><p>Beck hailed DeForest as “a tremendous person and comedian”, adding: “All of us in the New York&nbsp;comedy&nbsp;scene are truly devastated.”</p><p>Tributes have poured in for the tragic-comic, with the X account of&nbsp;Late Night with Seth Meyers, on which DeForest previously appeared, saying: “Kenny DeForest was a universally beloved comedian who died tragically, and much too young. His relaxed, confident delivery always stood out.”</p><p>The social media page shared a clip from one of DeForest’s routines on the show, adding: “As you can see from his debut late-night set on&nbsp;LNSM, he wasn’t afraid to tackle controversial topics, but never just to be edgy – always in service of an original angle and a great joke. It’s a shame we won’t get to see what he comes up with next.”</p><p>Comedian Adam Conover, 40, called DeForest’s death “a tragedy”, hailing him as “one of the funniest and most beloved comics any of us knew”.</p><p>DeForest started out performing on the comedy circuit in Missouri before relocating to New York. He made his debut appearance on&nbsp;Late Night With Seth Meyers&nbsp;in 2017 and went on to feature on&nbsp;The Late Late Show with James Corden.</p><p>On Facebook, his cousin Jessica Stone gave an update about his condition before his death writing:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ghbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kens.jpg><p>“Please keep praying for my cousin Kenny DeForest. 🙏💜 For those that missed my post the other day he was hit by a car while riding his bike over the weekend. He had to have brain surgery and is in NURO ICU. There is a go fund me set up to help with bills and care. I’ll post in the comments. I’ll also share his linktree. Buy some merch or his bad dreams comedy show. Anything helps. And please just keep praying”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kenny-deforest-funeral><strong>Kenny Deforest funeral</strong></h2><p>The family has not yet announced any details regarding Kenny DeForest’s funeral.
