1980, he was offered the job of freelance business agent Victor Newman on the daytime soap opera The Young and the Restless.&nbsp;At first, the job was for a 26-week run.&nbsp;His character held the darling of his half, and turned out to be so common that the character turned into a hate-loving villain, and his deal was expanded.</span></p><p><span>Braeden won a Daytime Emmy for his work in 1998, and in February 2017 he celebrated his 37th anniversary with the show.&nbsp;In 2020, the show designated Braeden’s 40th commemoration as on-screen Victor.</span></p><p><span>In October 2009, Braeden and The Young and the Restless reached an impasse regarding contract exchanges, and press reports demonstrated that he may be leaving the show.&nbsp;Nonetheless, CBS later said Braeden signed another three-year deal and would stay with the cleaner, and agreed to take a pay cut, which was the first issue.</span></p><h2><span>ERIC BRAEDEN CAREER</span></h2><p><span>Braeden amassed numerous television and film credits during his first two decades in America and starred in 120 roles.&nbsp;His early credits were all under his original name, Hans Gudegast.&nbsp;During the 1960s, he appeared

as Major Bentz of the Luftwaffe in scene 28, “Moment of retribution,” of season two of the TV arrangement Twelve O’Clock High (an arrangement that was inaccurately based on the big movie similarly named 1949 war drama) and additionally appeared in a scene from the 1966 recognition dramatization arrangement Blue Light.&nbsp;His foundational character for the next two years was his regular starring German Hauptmann (Captain) Hans Dietrich on the television arrangement The Rat Patrol (1966-1968),</span></p><p><span>He starred in the 1969 western 100 Rifles starring Raquel Welch, Burt Reynolds and Jim Brown (known for the major big-screen interracial love scene among Welch and Brown), playing in effect a wretched reverse German military official Fernando Lamas.&nbsp;It was his last credit under his original name.</span></p><p><span>His starring work in the film Colossus: The Forbin Project (1970), was when he previously made that big appearance by the name of Eric Braeden.&nbsp;Lew Wasserman of Universal Pictures revealed to him that no one would be allowed to act in an American film if he had a German name.&nbsp;After many ideas, he took the name Braeden from his old neighborhood of Bredenbek.</span></p><p><span>Other film appearances in the 1970s incorporated the work of Dr. Otto Hasslein in Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971), and that of self-important but impressive racing vehicle driver Bruno von Stickle in 1977’s Herbie Goes to Monte by Walt Disney.&nbsp;Carl.&nbsp;Throughout the 1970s, he was also a guest on an assortment of network shows, including The Six Million Dollar Man, Wonder Woman, and The Mary Tyler Moore Show, and also appeared in a few scenes on the western arrangement of long-running CBS Gunsmoke.&nbsp;.</span></p><p><span>Despite many rambling jobs, Braeden also showed up as Colonel John Jacob Astor IV in the hit 1997 film Titanic. scary in this case for
