patient for infanticide.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It now houses up to 210 men after the female service closed in 2007.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The average length of stay at the hospital is five-and-a-half years however this is skewed by a few men who have stayed for for more than 30 years.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Patients are admitted from prison, court or a medium-secure hospital.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However some have not committed an offence but are considered to pose a high risk to society and need to be housed in a secure

patient torturing and killing another inmate to stopping obsessive ‘fans’ visiting high profile murderers with their children, mental health professionals opened up about their harrowing experiences in a Channel 5 show, Broadmoor: Serial Killers & High Security.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Professor Pamela Taylor, who worked as head of medical services at the institution, revealed how women would get solicitors to fight for their right to visit sex offenders with their own children in tow, and sent so many love letters to Sutcliffe that he couldn’t answer them all.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Another staff member who featured on the show was Dr Jackie Craissati MBE, who admitted reading about the crimes committed by the patients she treated left her ‘overwhelmed’

Peter Sutcliffe, who murdered 13 women and injured seven more in the 1970s</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Our job is not to dwell on what they’ve done in the past, it is to rehabilitate them,’ Professor Taylor says.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘People want contact with high profile patients, so I think it’s not any secret… that Peter Sutcliffe had a very big post bag.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It is claimed in the documentary that Sutcliffe received so many love letters from women that he didn’t have the time to respond to all of them.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Not only that, but the serial killer, who died in November last year, also received three to four visits a week from young women – a different one every time.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>True crime author Wensley Clarkson saw some of the letter penned by Sutcliffe while at Broadmoor.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘If I didn’t know who the author of those letters were, I’d think they were written by someone quite young, in their 20s or 30s,’ he says.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Someone who is very awkward with women who thought he could arouse them with writing these frothy 1950s, 1960s expressions like “supa-duppa” and “absolute bliss” and “how wonderful”.</p><img decoding=async id=i-f3d0b76c6206618b
