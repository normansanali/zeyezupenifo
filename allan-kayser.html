He is an actor best known for his work on the television sitcom “Mama’s Family,” which he starred in for the entire run. During the 1980s, he was a teen idol, working in both television and film ventures.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Allan_Kayser_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Allan Kayser? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Allan Kayser’s <strong>net worth</strong> is believed to be more than $1.5 million as of 2022, achieved from success in the entertainment industry.</p><p>While he is best known for his work in the 1980s, he continued to work as an actor until the early 2010s.</p><h2><span id=Allan_Kayser-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Allan Kayser- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Allan grew up in Littleton and knew from a young age that he wanted to be an actor. He went to Columbine High School, a public high school in the Denver Metropolitan Area. He attended the school long before the tragic 1999 massacre that killed 13 people in one of the deadliest school shootings in US history.</p><p>After graduating from high school, he relocated to Los Angeles, California in search of performing opportunities. He eventually succeeded, and received his first assignment in 1985, portraying the character Jason in the comedy film “Hot Chili,” which also starred Joe Rubbo and Taaffe O’Connell and was directed by William Sachs, but received mainly unfavorable reviews. The next year, he was cast in “Night of the Creeps,” directed by Fred Dekker, who would subsequently collaborate on “RoboCop 3,” which starred Jason Lively and Jill Whitlow.</p><p>The film is an homage to the B movie genre, with elements of alien invasion and slasher films thrown in for good measure.</p><h2><span id=Allan_Kayser-_Relationship_Married_Life>Allan Kayser- Relationship, Married Life</span></h2><p>Allan’s first marriage was to Lori, and the pair had two children together before divorcing.<br>His second marriage took place in 2014, a year after his final acting endeavor, and he married Sara, with whom he has two daughters.</p><p>Allan is one of many young performers who rose to prominence in the 1980s but were unable to maintain it as they got older. While he did take on acting roles, he did not garner the same level of national notice as he had during his tenure on “Mama’s Family.” He has avoided the media since his retirement from the performing business in 2013.</p><h2><span id=Allan_Kayser-_Professional_Career>Allan Kayser- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Kayser was subsequently cast in his most notable project, the sitcom “Mama’s Family,” where he played Mitchel “Bubba” Higgins for the next four years. The comedy is a spin-off of the periodic series “The Family” from “The Carol Burnett Show.” The premise for the show began as comedy sketch parts before being developed into a television movie named “Eunice,” which led to the birth of the sitcom.</p><p>The titular Mama is played by Vicki Lawrence, and the show originally aired on NBC before being canceled after two seasons. However, it was then resurrected for fresh episodes, achieving greater ratings until it was canceled in 1990.</p><p>He appeared in 95 episodes of the show and obtained more opportunities as a result of its success. Allan mostly appeared as a guest on television game programs, such as “The $25,000 Pyramid,” which paired celebrities with normal contestants.</p><p>He also appeared in two episodes of “The New Hollywood Squares,” as well as “Circus of the Stars” and a special appearance on his co-star Vicki Lawrence’s talk program “Vicki!” which aired in 1992.</p><h3><span id=Later_in_Life>Later in Life</span></h3><p>Following the conclusion of “Mama’s Family,” Allan continued to take on acting roles, primarily in independent films. In 2002, he appeared in a minor role in “Double Teamed,” a Disney Channel original film based on the lives of professional basketball stars Heidi Burge and Heather Burge.<br>He took extended intervals between films and stepped away for a few years before returning for the film “All Roads Lead Home,” in which he co-starred with Peter Boyle and Patton Oswalt. The film was shot in the Kansas City area and had its world premiere at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, although it garnered mixed reviews.</p><p>During this time, he also worked on “More Than Puppy Love,” “Shimmer,” and “Journey of the Heart.” One of his most recent endeavors was 2013’s “House of Forbidden Secrets,” in which he played Brad with Lew Temple and Dyanne Thorne.</p><p>The horror film was also shot in Kansas, and it was nominated for multiple honors at the PollyGrind Film Festival. After his second marriage, he declined to embark on any more performing roles and is most likely working in another sector; however, the specifics of this profession have not been made public, as no media outlet has covered his life after his acting career.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Cecilia Allman</a>, <a href=#>Marian Krawstor</a>, and <a href=#>Bronlie Jacobs</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Georgette Tissier</a></h3>Georgette Tissier estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
