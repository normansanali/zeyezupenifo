However, she has reportedly written songs about her beau Joe Alwyn. The pair have been together for almost four years now. Their relationship has been shrouded in mystery, for the most part. It is perhaps the singer's most private relationship ever.</p><p>The lovebirds reportedly self-isolated together during the Coronavirus lockdown in April 2020. This, of course, sparked some engagement rumors but as it turns out, they were just that - rumors.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a>, "The actor provided a rare glimpse into his and Swift's private life by sharing photos of Benjamin Button, one of the pop star's three cats, on his Instagram story. In the pictures, the cat lays in a paper bag, hides under a rug, and pokes his head out of a cardboard box. "</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Although the "Clean" singer didn't appear in his story, fans recognized Benjamin from her own social media activity and realized that Alwyn was self-isolating with Swift during the coronavirus pandemic."</p><p>Due to the private nature of the relationship, fans and critics alike have speculated a breakup, an engagement, and secret wedding plans. However, none of these hold any water, and neither Taylor nor Joe has acknowledged any of these speculations. It's unknown whether a wedding is in their future. The pair is seemingly madly in love and fans are rooting for them. Perhaps Taylor has finally found the one... only time will tell.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Does Bella Hadid Want To Look Like Her Sister Gigi?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp2WZo8CqsMRmo6inm2KutXnTmrClp6JiwLi1xa2qZqSfq7JuuMifnGg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./buffalo-wild-wings-drinks-menu-and-prices.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Buffalo Wild Wings Drinks Menu and Prices - SarkariResult">&larr;
