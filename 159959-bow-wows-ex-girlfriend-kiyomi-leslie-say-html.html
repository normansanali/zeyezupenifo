She even drags his family who she says covered up for him.</p><p class=dh>Bow Wow has a lot to answer for after his ex-girlfriend Kiyomi Leslie accused him of causing her miscarriage.</p><p class=dh>Kiyomi went on a Twitter rampage blasting the “Growing Up Hip Hop” star for subjecting her to domestic abuse during their relationship. Among other things, she claimed he punched her pregnant stomach and resulting to the loss of her unborn child.</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>THE PUBLIC IS AWARE OF THEIR VIOLENT PAST</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>If you recall, the former lovers were <a class="me a" href=#>arrested</a> in February after a violent fight at the elevator of an apartment complex. Footage of that fight was later released on revealing Bow Wow being aggressive with his Kiyomi. They were both charged with battery for that incident.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>"She ain’t have no scars on her. I don’t think y ‘all really understand this girl went through my s–t."</strong></h3><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>BOW WOW ABSOLVES HIMSELF OF GUILT</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>In a recent episode of “Growing Up Hip Hop: Atlanta,” Bow Wow defended his actions that day by saying it was him who was the victim. He admitted to cursing Kiyomi but not laying a hand on her.</p><p class=dh>“I didn’t touch her. My face was f–ked up,” Bow Wow <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/By-QiFWjp_g/?utm_source=ig_embed">said</a>, seemingly justifying his behavior. “She ain’t have no scars on her. I don’t think y ‘all really understand this girl went through my s–t. [She went through] my phone.”</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>“He beat me while I was pregnant. Punched me in my stomach & all"</strong></h3><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>KIYOMI LASHES OUT WITH A SEVERE ACCUSATION</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>In response to Bow Wow’s version of the story, Kiyomi lashed out on Twitter to set things straight.</p><p class=dh>“Bet he won’t tell y’all the police been called out more than that one occasion and his family lied & covered for him that time,” she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://twitter.com/Thee_Kiyomi/status/1145145692530368512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1145145692530368512&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmadamenoire.com%2F1080034%2Fkiyomi-leslie-says-physical-abuse-from-bow-wow-caused-miscarriage%2F">began</a>. “He beat me while I was pregnant.

She said she didn’t reveal her bruises on TV but the police have proof. She likewise dragged Bow Wow’s family and accused them of demeaning her. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://twitter.com/Thee_Kiyomi/status/1145143781743845376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1145143781743845376&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmadamenoire.com%2F1080034%2Fkiyomi-leslie-says-physical-abuse-from-bow-wow-caused-miscarriage%2F">had a few choice words</a> for his mother.</p><p class=dh>“If y’all believe that lame ass n*** a didn’t do NOTHING. Y’all need to be in a mental home with him and his momma...”</p><p class=dh>“I wish I would turned him down and kept it moving.”</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>There’s no reason you should be that close cussing someone out if you don’t want to fight. He was the aggressor in this situation</strong></h3><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>FANS SLAM BOW WOW</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Kiyomi’s claims seem to be validated by fans who slammed Bow Wow for not taking responsibility for his actions in the episode of “Growing Up Hip Hop” where he shares his side of the story.</p><p class=dh>“Own up to the being aggressive with females. There’s no reason you should be that close cussing someone out if you don’t want to fight. He was the aggressor in this situation,” one viewer <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://atlantablackstar.com/2019/06/21/own-up-to-it-guhhatl-fans-slam-bow-wow-for-aggressive-behavior-in-alleged-fight-with-kiyomi-leslie-after-elevator-video-resurfaces/>wrote</a>.</p><p class=dh>“Wow he’s not taking any ownership smh. Getting up in my face like that will get you more than scratched up so he’s lucky,” another <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://atlantablackstar.com/2019/06/21/own-up-to-it-guhhatl-fans-slam-bow-wow-for-aggressive-behavior-in-alleged-fight-with-kiyomi-leslie-after-elevator-video-resurfaces/>said.</a></p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>ANOTHER SCORNED WOMAN SMASHES HIS CAR</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Meanwhile, another woman seems to be after Bow Wow too after he discovered his vehicle’s window had been smashed recently.</p><p class=dh>The rapper shared a photo of the damage on his Mercedes Benz G-Wagon and was evidently pissed in his caption.</p><p class=dh>“Really? So this is what you do?” he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/By-X9uvgVNJ/?utm_source=ig_embed">writes</a> and reveals a woman was responsible when he later adds, “Come on girl.”</p><p class=dh>It’s unclear who the woman is but it’s certainly someone who hates him enough to do that. Could it be Kiyomi still? Or another woman who shares her sentiments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpscnFlbnqju9Zmrqivo2KyuXnGoqmlnqKesq%2BwjKSgsqednnqtsdKloJ5lo5bGb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dottie-schonely-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-694940-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dottie Schonely Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr;
