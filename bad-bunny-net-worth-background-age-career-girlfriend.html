He is regarded as the greatest trap musician working today. Despite the fact that his tracks are primarily in Spanish or Latin, well-known artists like Enrique Iglesias have included Bad Bunny in their songs. Additionally, he is credited with popularizing Latin trap among music fans all over the world. When DJ Luian of “Hear This Music” heard his song “Diles,” he became well-known as a trap vocalist.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bad_Bunny_net_worth></span>Bad Bunny net worth <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rapper, singer, and composer Bad Bunny, who is from Puerto Rico, has an estimated <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> of $18 million in wealth. Within a relatively short amount of time, Bunny rose to popularity in a spectacular way. With a total of 8 billion streams of his songs in 2020, Bad Bunny was the most streamed musician in the entire planet. His music is often categorized as “Latin rap” or reggaeton, however he has also experimented with rock, bachata, and soul. In addition to his distinctive sense of flair, Bad Bunny is renowned for his slurred vocal delivery.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_is_Bad_Bunny_from></span>Where is Bad Bunny from? <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Benito Antonio Martnez Ocasio, better known as Bad Bunny, was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on March 10, 1994.

Along with his two younger siblings, Bad Bunny grew up in Vega Baja.</p><p>After hearing an album by the renowned reggaeton artist Vico C, he began singing at a very young age. He knew he wanted to be a singer by the time he was five years old. He began writing songs at the age of 13, and some of them he even produced.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Education></span>Education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bad Bunny studied audiovisual communication at “The University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo.” He left the institution, though, in order to concentrate entirely on his musical career.

He began working with well-known musicians and established himself as a consistent artist for the record label “Hear this Music.”</p><p>He collaborated with Colombian musician J Balvin in 2017, and the result was the appearance of their song “Si Tu Novio Te Deja Sola” on Balvin’s successful album. Another song by Becky G called “Mayores” also had Bad Bunny. A booking agreement with “Cardenas Marketing Network” was eventually signed by Bad Bunny in the same year (CMN).</p><p>The song “Sensualidad,” which he later co-wrote with Prince Royce and J Balvin, peaked at number ten on the “Hot Latin Songs” list. Additionally, in November 2017, he released his single “T No Metes Cabra,” which peaked at number 38 on the chart for “Hot Latin Songs.”<br>Collaborations between the rapper and well-known musicians helped him gain fame.</p><p>He ultimately rose to prominence as one of the most in-demand trap musicians and began attracting fans from around the world. With more than four billion YouTube views, Bad Bunny also rose to fame. Additionally, he has a sizable fan base on his own Instagram account. Bad Bunny receives 5.7 million monthly listeners on Spotify.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Personal_Life></span>Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He launched a campaign to save a young boy’s life in January 2018. The youngster needed a heart transplant, so he utilized his fame to gather money for him. Additionally, Bad Bunny gave $100,000 to help save the boy.</p><p>Wrestling is something he loves a lot. His Instagram profile is filled with several images and videos of wrestlers. He has posted a lot of photos that were taken with Goldberg and Ronda Rousey, two of the biggest stars in the WWE. Ric Flair, a former wrestler, made an appearance in one of his music videos.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Awards_and_Achievements></span>Awards and Achievements <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Not only have many of his tracks reached different music charts, but they have also received nominations for significant awards.
